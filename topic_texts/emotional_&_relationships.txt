No one was screaming, Harry.
How are you feeling?
What's wrong, Harry?
Are you okay?
That's great.
That felt good.
Harry, no way! ... You don't even know how to fly. What an idiot.
That looks really painful.
McGonagall is worried. All the teachers are.
Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
Ow! You stood on my foot!
I can't believe it—she's done it again...
Come on! Everyone's been worried.
Oh, no. Okay, relax.
Get off me!
I don't like this. Not at all.
Are you all right?
She's a little sensitive.
Oh I'm sorry.
That's what you think?
If you're talking about Malfoy.
Sorry I'll just go.
I won't be going alone—someone asked me.
We know the truth. Please believe us.
I don't like flying!
Are you alright? You must be freezing!
You foul loathsome evil little cockroach!
Don't forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.
Just forget it.
Just ignore him.
Uh... we were just...
Thanks, Sir Nicholas!
This is horrible.
You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
It's a bit strange, isn't it?
Go Harry! Go Harry!
You foul loathsome evil little cockroach!
He's not relaxing, is he?
Are you okay?
Do you think he's all right?
Something my mum used to say.
Ron you spoil everything!
She said yes??
Everything's going to change now isn't it?
Wake up Ronald!
No one blames you Harry. Dumbledore is furious.
We've been through enough—just do it yourself.
That was so scary.
That's why he gave you chocolate.
At least someone's enjoying himself.
Honestly Ron, it's not funny.
Look—it's Lupin.
I meant me!
Is that really what my hair looks like?
I'm NOT an owl!
You'll be okay Harry. You're a great wizard.
They're not for Ginny—they're for you!
Thanks. Malfoy's coming.
Hope you don't mean yourself!
That's totally barbaric!
Hagrid's our friend. Let's go ask him.
Harry, you can't.
Sorry Ron, you can't walk...
You okay Ron? Say something!
It's not funny Ron.
Ron. Ron! Ron!
It can't be Hagrid. It just can't.
Neville's already got someone.
How dare you! I can take care of myself.
I think they're funny.
We'll stay with you Hagrid.
We can do this—the three of us.
Stop it! It's bothering him!
Harry are you all right?
What's got your wand in a knot?
I’m not going. You go without me!
Next time ask me before someone else does.
Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
I think that means you owe someone an apology.
Ouch Ron that was my foot.
I don't know.
Oh it's so good to see you!
Hot isn't it? Viktor’s getting drinks.
Draco’s father is furious.
Look who it is—Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her.
That's Ariana, isn't it? Your sister. She's beautiful.
That felt good.
Feels strange to be going home.
Harry! Harry!
Couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying --
Krum!!!
Don' you worry.  He'll be 'long soon 'nuff --
No. I felt weird, though. Like I'd never be cheerful again.
Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud.
What does he get a hug for?
Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.
Uhh-um Welcome back, Hermione.
What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.
Serves her right. She was a terrible singer.
He saved your life.
No, you don't understand -- Oh, bloody hell...
Dumbledore?  And me?  I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley to him.  He was always polite --
C'mon.  Mum's got dinner ready.
Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?
But I'm your brother!
What do you suppose Dean sees in her?  Ginny.
I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.
Shove off, Malfoy.
Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.
Fine.  I get it.  I saw you two the other night.  Yeah, that's right.  Didn't know I knew, did you?
Uh Harry?
Ginny these must be for you.
Listen to the idiot. He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
So.  Did you and Ginny do it?
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.
Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.
Hermione's got nice skin. Wouldn't you say?  As skin goes, I mean.
That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us!  Dumbledore again!
Snogging?  Who're you talking about?
I gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit.
Exactly! Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great- greatgreat grandson, or something.
Mum fancies him.
Six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm Frankie First Year. I mean, I'm only her brother.
I'm fine!
Luna?
We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy.
Thank you Nigel.
This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
Quiet. Let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry. It was badly wrapped. They made me do it.
Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.
Hermione!
Weasley... Barney Weasley.
Do you think she knows I exist?
I feel really... bad.
We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.
Do you think it'd be all right if we had some of this?
Lav, c'mon. Of course I'll wear it.
How long you reckon she'll stay mad at me?
Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.
I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo.
That was wicked, Harry!
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating.
Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.
She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental... but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.
No.  He's worried he should have got more money for it.
I'll be right back.  Want to play chess?
Come off it, Hagrid! We're not blind!
Hermione!!
Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.
She could never annoy me.  I think... I think I love her.
Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!
Harry!
There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist.
Now I'm really depressed.
You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.
Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.
Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
Mind you, I mean, we did save her life.
He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.
Happy Christmas, Harry.
I expect you'll be going with McLaggen.  Isn't he a member of the Slug Club?
There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out.
Dress robes? for what?
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop. We never did got a chance to go to the Shrieking Shack though. You heard it's the most...
What are friends for?
Where's Romilda?
So painful. They might chop it.
Well, you sort of went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
Harry, I don't like this Harry, I don't like this at all!
Dean?  He's brilliant.
Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.
Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?
Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out.
She needs to sort out her priorities!
Well, us and Neville!
All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.
You're the best with spells.
Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know.
Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.
Oh, yeah. Um... Well, Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering. And that there could be the sun and that's happiness. So... you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be... happy about it.
Piss off!  Arthur Weasley's ten times the wizard you are!
Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.  What Lav and I have -- well, let's just say there was no stopping it.  It's chemical.  Will it last?  Who knows?  Point is, I'm a free agent.
Harry!
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??
Bill and Fleur.  Mum's been planning it for months.  Only thing that's kept her sane, I reckon.  She'll kill me if I miss it.  Kill you too.  Rather go face to face with You-Know-Who if I'm honest.
Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny.
It's not much, but it's home.
How do I look?
Hello, darling.  Fancy a drink?
I think I'm gonna be sick!
It's a creepy shop.  He's a creepy bloke.
Not bloody likely.  Smells like something Ginny would cook.
Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione.  Cormac.
You're asking us? You're the brilliant one.
Midnight.  Mum always said midnight. But twilight's fine.  Better actually.
Piece of advice.  Let's not rehash old times.  Got it... mate?
And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction?
Is there something you wish to tell me?
It is my fault Sirius died tonight.
But this is touching, Severus. Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy?
Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.
You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry.
My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist.
Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.
Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed.  Pip pip!
I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year.
At times I forget how much you've grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man.
My fault.  It's all my fault...
Confused?  I would be surprised if you weren't.
Mind if I take this?  I do love knitting patterns.
I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you.
Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on. All right. It'll be all right.
Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp.
Haven't you wondered why I haven't spoken to you, even looked at you, for months?
I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl.
That wasn't my intention.
Your word, Harry.
Good evening, Draco.  What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening?  Or is it Summer?
You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must.
Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don't you? Mind?
No, Harry. I do not think it was you But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?
I suspect he is ashamed of it.
I understand how you feel, Harry--
Forgive me, Harry, I...
He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated.
You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn't trust
You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it.
Are you alright Alastor?
Is Arthur seriously injured?
I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk.  No light could resist it...
Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called.
I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.  One can't help but wonder if --
Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are.
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.  I will not negotiate this with you, Severus.  You agreed.  There's nothing more to discuss.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. How could you? You've been with us all the time.
