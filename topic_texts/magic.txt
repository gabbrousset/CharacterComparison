I know a spell when I see one... Snape wasn't blinking.
This is a Time Turner Harry.
A Patronus requires a powerful wizard.
I've read about those. When the smoke turns red, it means you've forgotten something.
The Polyjuice Potion allows transformation.
It was cat hair. Look at my face!
An Animagus elects to transform...
This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it.
Slytherin was a Parselmouth... snakes.
No! With a proper wand it's too risky!
Are you sure that's a real spell? ... Oculus Reparo. ... you're Harry Potter.
It's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.
You can talk to snakes.
How are you feeling? Concentrate...
Sleeping Draught... once they're asleep...
Your wand Harry! Your wand!
What did you do to your glasses? Oculus Reparo.
It's not real, the ceiling. It's bewitched... I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.
Neville, I'm sorry... Petrificus Totalus.
We'll have one hour before changing back.
Up. Up. Up. Up.
What are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.
Oh, move over! Alohomora. Get in.
I got this from Millicent’s robes... checking Polyjuice.
Swish and flick!
Stop, you're going to take someone's eye out. It's Levi-o-sa.
Devil's Snare hates sunlight! Lumos Solem!
How fast is it Harry?
Don't tell her I said that. Besides, you've still got the Trace on you.  And there's the wedding...
Riddikulus!
You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now.
-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!
Expellliarmus!
Well, you fell off your broom.
I could feel it inside me.  It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea.  And I knew it would take me where I needed to go.
That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
Alohomora?
So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.  And I knew.
They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!
Leg-Locker Curse?
Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?
It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaaar.  She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!
So I Disapparated and came out on this hillside.  It was dark.  I didn't have any idea where I was. I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end. And you did.
Ahem. Vera verto!
You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us?
The flying gear's jammed!
I've always liked it.  These flames Hermione makes.
I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak.
Lockhart's memory charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is!
But, it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'll just go right through you.
Alohomora!  Well, it was worth a try.
Stupify!
Finite Incantatem, okay.  And if that doesn't work...?
You're supposed to stroke it.
Oh no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty!
That's wizard's chess.  I see you've packed.
Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?
They're really rare.  I wonder who gave it to you?
Lumos !
I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?
You're supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible.  Dead boring if you ask me.  But an unbeatable wand!
Wingardrium Leviosar!
Ahh-ha-ha! My wand! Look at my wand!
Wand out, Harry.
We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution to all.
You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things the other children can't.
Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared.
This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia.
Ingenious.  Let me guess.  It has a sister.  A twin.
No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate.
Indeed.  And quite successfully I might add.  Most people vomit their first time.
I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.
Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them.
