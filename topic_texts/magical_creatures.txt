Ronald has lost his rat.
Dean was told by Parvati... Hagrid's looking for you.
Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
Do you mind me trying? The Grim possibly.
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
The Egyptians used to worship cats.
Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
Come on Buckbeak—dead ferret!
Buckbeak—come quickly!
Take better care of your pets!
Come on Buckbeak!
Most haunted building in Britain.
Crookshanks ignore the mean little boy.
Well that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.
Keep trying—come on Buckbeak!
Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.
That thing has a name?
But why would anyone go near that dog?
Is that... a dragon?
It's a cat, Ronald. It's his nature.
Look at your tail!
So...no giants are coming?
Moaning Myrtle.
Scabbers, you bit me!
Spiders! There's... There's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap-dance. I don't wanna tap-dance!
Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. He was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat. But then they gave him an owl...
Bloody bird's a menace. Oh, no!
I don't like spiders What's that?
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone.
He bit me! Scabbers!
Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?  This is Scabbers, by the way, pathetic, isn't he?
I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!
Scabbers! You're alive!
That'll be a cheerful visit! Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?â
It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan.
What are you trying to do to him? Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing?
Scabbers, come back!
Barking.  Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What?
We go and visit Hagrid?
Just the drewbals, thanks.
It's angry.
Spider?  About six feet tall?  Ten feet wide?
Brilliant. Loads of old stuff... like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
Change of plans, my parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there.
A cat? Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair.
I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!
Who's Moaning Myrtle?
Scabbers has been in my family for...
Werewolves?
At least I warned you about the dragons.
. Green. That's a monkey. What is that? You call that a monkey? Do not give him one again. Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
Along with the dung beetle.
What's with the birds?
There's something else you should know too. When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and... Well...
They're headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldn't it be follow the butterflies?â
Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!
And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?
Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them.
Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers.
Oh, and about time, too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes.
