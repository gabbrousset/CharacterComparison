222,Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.,Hermione Granger
224,"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.",Hermione Granger
226,"Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...  Oculus Reparo.  That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?",Hermione Granger
228,"Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.  You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there.",Hermione Granger
241,"It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.",Hermione Granger
245,"Oh, no. Okay, relax.",Hermione Granger
282,Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?,Hermione Granger
317,"I've read about those. When the smoke turns red,  it means you've forgotten something.",Hermione Granger
327,Up. Up. Up. Up.,Hermione Granger
353,"Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly.  What an idiot.",Hermione Granger
375,You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.,Hermione Granger
382,"The staircases change, remember?",Hermione Granger
386,We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.,Hermione Granger
393,"Oh, move over!  Alohomora.  Get in.",Hermione Granger
395,"Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.",Hermione Granger
397,Filch is gone.,Hermione Granger
399,It was locked.,Hermione Granger
403,"You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?",Hermione Granger
405,It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.,Hermione Granger
407,"That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse, expelled!",Hermione Granger
424,"Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar.",Hermione Granger
426,Wingardium Leviosa.,Hermione Granger
447,Help! Help!,Hermione Granger
449,Ahhh! Help!,Hermione Granger
456,Swish and flick!,Hermione Granger
458,Is it...dead?,Hermione Granger
463,"It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.",Hermione Granger
465,I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.,Hermione Granger
473,"Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.",Hermione Granger
477,Blood?,Hermione Granger
479,But why would anyone go near that dog?,Hermione Granger
481,So you're saying...,Hermione Granger
483,"Bit early for mail, isn't it?",Hermione Granger
513,It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!,Hermione Granger
515,Leave it to me.,Hermione Granger
517,Lacarnum Inflamarae.,Hermione Granger
527,Whoo-hoo!,Hermione Granger
533,That thing has a name?,Hermione Granger
539,"Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking.",Hermione Granger
545,I don't know.,Hermione Granger
549,That's totally barbaric!,Hermione Granger
551,See you haven't.,Hermione Granger
553,"Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.",Hermione Granger
555,Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas.,Hermione Granger
600,Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.,Hermione Granger
602,"All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?",Hermione Granger
604,"And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?",Hermione Granger
606,"No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.",Hermione Granger
620,Follow me!,Hermione Granger
622,I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.,Hermione Granger
624,"Of course! Here it is!  ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!""",Hermione Granger
627,"Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.""",Hermione Granger
629,It means you'll never die.,Hermione Granger
632,"""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!",Hermione Granger
636,We know about the Philosopher's Stone!,Hermione Granger
646,"Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.",Hermione Granger
652,Is that...a dragon?,Hermione Granger
672,"Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.",Hermione Granger
697,Harry!,Hermione Granger
700,"You mean You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?",Hermione Granger
705,"Hang on a minute.  We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched.",Hermione Granger
706,"I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.",Hermione Granger
709,It's happened before.,Hermione Granger
713,What is it?,Hermione Granger
728,And with Dumbledore gone,Hermione Granger
730,Uh...we were just...,Hermione Granger
732,Now what do we do?,Hermione Granger
739,"Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this... Petrificus Totalus.",Hermione Granger
742,Sorry.,Hermione Granger
744,Ow! You stood on my foot!,Hermione Granger
746,Alohomora.,Hermione Granger
753,The harp. It stopped playing.,Hermione Granger
758,"Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.",Hermione Granger
763,Just relax!,Hermione Granger
765,Do what I say. Trust me.,Hermione Granger
768,Are you okay?,Hermione Granger
771,"He's not relaxing, is he?",Hermione Granger
774,We've got to do something!,Hermione Granger
776,Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology.,Hermione Granger
778,"Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,  it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!  Lumos Solem!",Hermione Granger
785,What is that?,Hermione Granger
787,Curious. I've never seen birds like these.,Hermione Granger
789,What's this all about?,Hermione Granger
792,Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!,Hermione Granger
795,"What's wrong, Harry?",Hermione Granger
801,I don't like this. I don't like this at all.,Hermione Granger
805,Now what do we do?,Hermione Granger
807,What happens now?,Hermione Granger
809,"Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?",Hermione Granger
815,What is it?,Hermione Granger
817,"No, Ron, you can't!  There must be another way!",Hermione Granger
822,"You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.",Hermione Granger
824,"Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.",Hermione Granger
869,Never better.,Hermione Granger
871,We're tied with Slytherin!,Hermione Granger
877,"Come on, Harry.",Hermione Granger
884,"Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?",Hermione Granger
1043,Harry! Hagrid!,Hermione Granger
1045,"Oh, it's so good to see you!",Hermione Granger
1047,What did you do to your glasses? Oculus reparo.,Hermione Granger
1050,Ok! Bye!,Hermione Granger
1052,Come on! Everyone's been so worried.,Hermione Granger
1069,Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.,Hermione Granger
1147,"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.",Hermione Granger
1176,Get off me!,Hermione Granger
1184,Immobulus!,Hermione Granger
1197,At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent.,Hermione Granger
1202,"You okay, Ron? Say something!",Hermione Granger
1213,He called me a Mudblood.,Hermione Granger
1216,It means dirty blood.â Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.,Hermione Granger
1233,Harry!,Hermione Granger
1237,Voice? What voice?,Hermione Granger
1242,"Harry, wait! Not so fast!",Hermione Granger
1245,The Chamber of Secrets has been opened enemies the heir beware.' It's written in blood.,Hermione Granger
1263,"That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when he said",Hermione Granger
1269,"It's a bit strange, isn't it?",Hermione Granger
1271,"You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.",Hermione Granger
1274,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.",Hermione Granger
1280,"Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us aboutthe Chamber of Secrets?",Hermione Granger
1284,Muggle-borns.,Hermione Granger
1286,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?,Hermione Granger
1289,Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.,Hermione Granger
1291,"The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?",Hermione Granger
1293,If you're talking about Malfoy.,Hermione Granger
1295,"I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?",Hermione Granger
1298,"Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous.",Hermione Granger
1299,"Here it is. 'The Polyjuice Potion.'  'Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.'",Hermione Granger
1301,Yes.,Hermione Granger
1303,Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.,Hermione Granger
1305,A month.,Hermione Granger
1307,I know. But it's the only plan we've got.,Hermione Granger
1316,No! Even with a proper wand it's too risky. You could hit Harry!,Hermione Granger
1319,Let's go.,Hermione Granger
1321,Finite incantatem!,Hermione Granger
1323,Are you okay?,Hermione Granger
1337,"You will be able to, won't you?",Hermione Granger
1370,Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?,Hermione Granger
1372,Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.,Hermione Granger
1374,Heh No. No one ever comes in here.,Hermione Granger
1376,Moaning Myrtle.,Hermione Granger
1378,Moaning Myrtle.,Hermione Granger
1381,She's a little sensitive.,Hermione Granger
1385,Do you think he's all right?,Hermione Granger
1398,Oh!,Hermione Granger
1410,You can talk to snakes.,Hermione Granger
1412,"No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad.",Hermione Granger
1418,"I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too.",Hermione Granger
1421,"He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.",Hermione Granger
1450,Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.,Hermione Granger
1452,We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.,Hermione Granger
1454,"I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms.",Hermione Granger
1456,I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrodeâ Slytherin- I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.,Hermione Granger
1466,We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves Add the hairs.,Hermione Granger
1468,Cheers!,Hermione Granger
1470,Me too.,Hermione Granger
1479,I- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me!,Hermione Granger
1481,Just go. You're wasting time!,Hermione Granger
1511,Go away!,Hermione Granger
1515,Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat's hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face.,Hermione Granger
1566,It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.,Hermione Granger
1569,Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?,Hermione Granger
1574,No!,Hermione Granger
1579,It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student.,Hermione Granger
1859,"Thanks, Sir Nicholas!",Hermione Granger
1862,It's good to be back! Congratulations! I can't believe you solved it!,Hermione Granger
1864,Thanks.,Hermione Granger
1867,"Oh, no!",Hermione Granger
1957,"It's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect? It's in his nature.",Hermione Granger
1959,"That's rich... coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.",Hermione Granger
1961,Harry.,Hermione Granger
1964,You know the Egyptians used to worship cats?,Hermione Granger
1988,"Good morning, Mr. Weasley.",Hermione Granger
2006,"Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled.",Hermione Granger
2009,Come on. Everywhere else is full.,Hermione Granger
2011,Professor R.J. Lupin.,Hermione Granger
2013,"It's on his suitcase, Ronald.",Hermione Granger
2016,Seems to be. Why?,Hermione Granger
2020,"But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean, everyone's looking for him.",Hermione Granger
2023,Why are we stopping? We can't be there yet.,Hermione Granger
2026,"Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.",Hermione Granger
2029,"Harry. Harry, are you all right?",Hermione Granger
2039,"No one was screaming, Harry.",Hermione Granger
2041,"Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.",Hermione Granger
2045,Just forget it.,Hermione Granger
2060,What a load of rubbish.,Hermione Granger
2062,Me? I've been here all this time.,Hermione Granger
2072,"Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline. Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.",Hermione Granger
2074,A fair few.,Hermione Granger
2076,Don't be silly Ron. How could anyone be in two classes at once? Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future!.,Hermione Granger
2082,I think they're funny.,Hermione Granger
2086,Just ignore him.,Hermione Granger
2104,Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital.,Hermione Granger
2113,Yeah but I heard Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this.,Hermione Granger
2117,Dufftown? That's not far from here.,Hermione Granger
2124,No one knows.,Hermione Granger
2126,Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. That's what makes them so...,Hermione Granger
2168,"It's not funny, Ron.",Hermione Granger
2199,"But sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. We're not meant to start that for weeks.",Hermione Granger
2203,"Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon, when he transforms, he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path. Furthermore, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.",Hermione Granger
2209,"Go, Harry! Go, Harry!",Hermione Granger
2215,How are you feeling?,Hermione Granger
2221,"Umm... no one blames you, Harry. The dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. Dumbledore's furious. As soon as he saved you, he sent them off.",Hermione Granger
2277,It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?,Hermione Granger
2279,Do you want to move a bit closer?,Hermione Granger
2285,Hope you don't mean yourself!,Hermione Granger
2291,Harry!,Hermione Granger
2294,But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?,Hermione Granger
2296,"Oh, Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her.",Hermione Granger
2310,Harry!,Hermione Granger
2312,So rude.,Hermione Granger
2332,"Ron, look! Sorry, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Harry, what happened?",Hermione Granger
2353,Beautiful day.,Hermione Granger
2357,Ronald has lost his rat.,Hermione Granger
2359,Rubbish.,Hermione Granger
2361,"Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!",Hermione Granger
2363,Did not.,Hermione Granger
2365,Didn't.,Hermione Granger
2366,"How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?",Hermione Granger
2368,And then?,Hermione Granger
2412,"Oh, do you mind me trying? The Grim, possibly.",Hermione Granger
2425,I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.,Hermione Granger
2428,"You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!",Hermione Granger
2432,That felt good.,Hermione Granger
2437,"We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.",Hermione Granger
2441,I think that means you owe someone an apology.,Hermione Granger
2443,I meant me!,Hermione Granger
2465,I thought I just saw... Never mind.,Hermione Granger
2470,Ron. Ron! Ron!,Hermione Granger
2474,"Harry, you do realize what tree this is?",Hermione Granger
2477,"Ron! Ron, wait! Harry!",Hermione Granger
2480,Duck!,Hermione Granger
2481,Harry!,Hermione Granger
2482,"Oh, I'm sorry.",Hermione Granger
2484,Where do you suppose this goes?,Hermione Granger
2486,"We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?",Hermione Granger
2488,Ron. You're okay. The dog. Where is it?,Hermione Granger
2490,"If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!",Hermione Granger
2500,"No! I trusted you! And all this time, you've been his friend. He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes.",Hermione Granger
2502,Since Professor Snape set the essay.,Hermione Granger
2528,You attacked a teacher!,Hermione Granger
2562,"You go, I'll stay.",Hermione Granger
2565,That looks really painful.,Hermione Granger
2567,I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.,Hermione Granger
2578,Harry!,Hermione Granger
2581,Harry!,Hermione Granger
2584,Wait! Wait!,Hermione Granger
2586,Professor? Professor Lupin?,Hermione Granger
2592,Harry?,Hermione Granger
2594,What?,Hermione Granger
2596,"Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius. Any minute the dementors are going to perform the Kiss.",Hermione Granger
2598,"No. It's worse. Much worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster, you've got to stop them. They've got the wrong man.",Hermione Granger
2603,"The point is, we know the truth. Please believe us.",Hermione Granger
2606,"Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...",Hermione Granger
2608,7:30. Where were we at 7:30?,Hermione Granger
2610,Come on. And we can't be seen.,Hermione Granger
2612,"You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!",Hermione Granger
2616,"This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.",Hermione Granger
2618,"Yes. Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.",Hermione Granger
2620,Thanks. Malfoy's coming.,Hermione Granger
2623,That felt good.,Hermione Granger
2627,"Of course. Remember what Dumbledore said? If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. Let's go.",Hermione Granger
2629,"Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.",Hermione Granger
2633,"Harry, you can't.",Hermione Granger
2635,"Yes, and you must! Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. We can't be seen.",Hermione Granger
2636,Fudge is coming. And we aren't leaving? Why aren't we leaving?,Hermione Granger
2640,Sorry. We're coming out the back door. Go!,Hermione Granger
2641,Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?,Hermione Granger
2643,I thought I just saw... Never mind.,Hermione Granger
2645,"Okay, go, Harry. Go!",Hermione Granger
2649,"Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on.",Hermione Granger
2650,Keep trying. Come on. Quickly. Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?,Hermione Granger
2653,"Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay? Come on. Come on, Buckbeak. Come and get the nice dead ferret. Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.",Hermione Granger
2661,"Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.",Hermione Granger
2674,Buckbeak.,Hermione Granger
2680,We save Sirius.,Hermione Granger
2682,No idea. Look. It's Lupin.,Hermione Granger
2684,And Snape's coming.,Hermione Granger
2686,And now we wait.,Hermione Granger
2687,At least someone's enjoying himself.,Hermione Granger
2689,Yeah?,Hermione Granger
2691,With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. According to him... only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.,Hermione Granger
2693,"Harry, but your dad's... Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw.",Hermione Granger
2694,Here we come.,Hermione Granger
2696,That's great.,Hermione Granger
2698,Harry! Run!,Hermione Granger
2700,Saving your life!,Hermione Granger
2702,"Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!",Hermione Granger
2703,That was so scary.,Hermione Granger
2705,This is horrible.,Hermione Granger
2707,"Harry, listen to me. No one's coming.",Hermione Granger
2709,You're dying... both of you. Harry!,Hermione Granger
2712,No.,Hermione Granger
2713,But I don't like flying...!,Hermione Granger
2714,Bombarda!,Hermione Granger
2722,We have to go.,Hermione Granger
2727,"What's he talking about, Harry?",Hermione Granger
2749,This came with it.,Hermione Granger
2752,"How fast is it, Harry?",Hermione Granger
2760,Harry!,Hermione Granger
2761,Are you alright?,Hermione Granger
2763,Just now. You?,Hermione Granger
2765,Wake up. Wake up Ronald!,Hermione Granger
2767,"Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready.",Hermione Granger
2789,What??,Hermione Granger
2837,Harry it's his mark.,Hermione Granger
2854,"This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?",Hermione Granger
2856,"It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.",Hermione Granger
2858,"You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream.",Hermione Granger
2876,Alastor Moody? The aura.,Hermione Granger
2888,Three sir.,Hermione Granger
2890,Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will...,Hermione Granger
2907,"Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!",Hermione Granger
2911,"There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face.",Hermione Granger
2912,Neville?,Hermione Granger
2919,It's not going to work.,Hermione Granger
2921,You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.,Hermione Granger
2923,So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.,Hermione Granger
2936,Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.,Hermione Granger
3016,We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?,Hermione Granger
3017,Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you.,Hermione Granger
3019,Uhhh...,Hermione Granger
3020,Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.,Hermione Granger
3022,I'm NOT an owl!,Hermione Granger
3082,Pssst! Harry? Is that you?,Hermione Granger
3084,How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...,Hermione Granger
3091,Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.,Hermione Granger
3103,Your wand harry! Your wand!,Hermione Granger
3121,Boys.,Hermione Granger
3122,Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.,Hermione Granger
3131,They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.,Hermione Granger
3157,It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.,Hermione Granger
3160,Oh well spotted.,Hermione Granger
3162,I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.,Hermione Granger
3179,What?,Hermione Granger
3181,No of course.,Hermione Granger
3182,She said yes??,Hermione Granger
3218,Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?,Hermione Granger
3220,What's got your wand in a knot?,Hermione Granger
3222,"The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends.",Hermione Granger
3227,How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.,Hermione Granger
3229,What? What? That's what you think?,Hermione Granger
3231,You know the solution then don't you.,Hermione Granger
3233,"Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort.",Hermione Granger
3235,Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.,Hermione Granger
3237,Ron you spoil everything!,Hermione Granger
3241,Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.,Hermione Granger
3243,"I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?",Hermione Granger
3245,"I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.",Hermione Granger
3265,"Harry, tell me again.",Hermione Granger
3267,"The black lake, that's obvious.",Hermione Granger
3269,"Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic",Hermione Granger
3271,"Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.",Hermione Granger
3273,"But sir, the second task is only hours away and...",Hermione Granger
3306,Harry!,Hermione Granger
3308,Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably.,Hermione Granger
3310,Next to last.,Hermione Granger
3484,Bye.,Hermione Granger
3487,No.,Hermione Granger
3489,Everything's going to change now isn't it?,Hermione Granger
3491,Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.,Hermione Granger
3493,Harry will won't you?,Hermione Granger
3600,Harry!,Hermione Granger
3602,"Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are!",Hermione Granger
3604,"Come on, inside.",Hermione Granger
3605,"Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to.",Hermione Granger
3609,He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary...,Hermione Granger
3618,"Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious Malfoy.",Hermione Granger
3620,The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term.,Hermione Granger
3664,"They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending",Hermione Granger
3669,Would you like a hug?,Hermione Granger
3772,"Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects! She hands Harry a letter.",Hermione Granger
3773,"What about you, Harry?",Hermione Granger
3774,Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one!,Hermione Granger
3786,I hope he's all right...,Hermione Granger
3812,I wanted to know something about your course aims.,Hermione Granger
3814,But surely the whole point of Defense against the dark arts is practical application?,Hermione Granger
3816,"No, but-",Hermione Granger
3818,But we've got O.W.L.s coming up! You expect us to do the spells with no practice?,Hermione Granger
3834,How can Dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? And when we're taking our OWL tests too!,Hermione Granger
3836,"Well, not us specifically, but definitely Dumbledore and the Order.",Hermione Granger
3843,"Good luck, Harry.",Hermione Granger
3852,"Hey, Harry.",Hermione Granger
3853,Have you seen Ron? I can't find him anywhere.,Hermione Granger
3855,He's been acting fishy all week. He's up to something.,Hermione Granger
3859,He's got to be taken to the hospital wing.,Hermione Granger
3862,That old hag! She's sick!,Hermione Granger
3864,"Harry, I really think you should tell--",Hermione Granger
3867,Hagrid's still not back yet. I hope he's all right.,Hermione Granger
3869,"Harry, you can't write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe.",Hermione Granger
3872,You think she's working for You- Know-Who?,Hermione Granger
3874,"I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it's unlikely. Dumbledore'd know.",Hermione Granger
3893,There we are.,Hermione Granger
3895,"Come on, I'll explain in a minute.",Hermione Granger
3897,These are some people I mentioned my Defense Against the Dark Arts idea with.,Hermione Granger
3903,"Obviously, this will help us pass our O.W.L.s, but more importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...Lord Voldemort. Several people jump or wince in fear at the name.",Hermione Granger
3908,"That's true, but I think we're drifting from the purpose--",Hermione Granger
3911,"Well...anyway...uh, I think that in order to learn properly we'll need a teacher.",Hermione Granger
3924,So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry?,Hermione Granger
3925,Where are we going to meet?,Hermione Granger
3928,"Ok, good.",Hermione Granger
3929,"I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here.",Hermione Granger
3931,"Honestly, Ernie, do you think I'd just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted.",Hermione Granger
3932,"Also, what should we call ourselves?",Hermione Granger
3935,We'll let you know when we're going,Hermione Granger
3936,I think that went well.,Hermione Granger
3938,"And did you see Cho, Harry?",Hermione Granger
3939,"Well, she couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?!",Hermione Granger
3951,"No, they couldn't have. The parchment we all signed was enchanted, like I said. No one can betray the D.A. without us knowing.",Hermione Granger
3954,She's hurt!,Hermione Granger
3956,"Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know what to do.",Hermione Granger
3984,"Harry, are you all right?",Hermione Granger
4015,I know something that could cheer you up.,Hermione Granger
4016,Hagrid's back!,Hermione Granger
4113,That's got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he was arrested.,Hermione Granger
4116,"It makes perfect sense, Ron. It's got to be something the Ministry's been developing. Something top secret.",Hermione Granger
4117,Look at this. There's been a mass escape from Azkaban.,Hermione Granger
4120,Yes.,Hermione Granger
4166,Hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour.,Hermione Granger
4170,We won't let her!,Hermione Granger
4171,Of course we'll help.,Hermione Granger
4175,"Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come!",Hermione Granger
4177,"Oh, why, Hagrid? Why?",Hermione Granger
4246,How do you know?,Hermione Granger
4251,"How'd Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world...",Hermione Granger
4253,"It just seems so unlikely, Harry!",Hermione Granger
4257,"Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you'd rush off to save Sirius.",Hermione Granger
4261,"Yes, they can, Harry.",Hermione Granger
4263,"Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at Headquarters. Which means we'll need to break into Umbridge's office.",Hermione Granger
4266,"Mind you, it's got to be really good!",Hermione Granger
4269,We'll also need to keep everyone away from her office.,Hermione Granger
4271,We'll probably only manage five minutes or so.,Hermione Granger
4275,"Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry.",Hermione Granger
4320,"No! Please, stop!",Hermione Granger
4323,"We have to tell her, Harry...",Hermione Granger
4326,We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him...,Hermione Granger
4328,That it's ready. The weapon.,Hermione Granger
4331,"Oh, yes. It's very well hidden.",Hermione Granger
4336,Don't call them that!,Hermione Granger
4351,"Grawp, help us!",Hermione Granger
4354,I thought it worked out rather nicely.,Hermione Granger
4357,I'd imagine we should fly.,Hermione Granger
4363,"There's nothing there, Harry.",Hermione Granger
4380,"Well, let's try a few.",Hermione Granger
4384,"There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room.",Hermione Granger
4389,"Harry, I think we should leave.",Hermione Granger
4396,I don't think Sirius is here.,Hermione Granger
4400,"Don't touch it, Harry!",Hermione Granger
4433,Stupify!,Hermione Granger
4435,Colloportus!,Hermione Granger
4437,"Harry, they went the wrong way!",Hermione Granger
4447,Silenco! Stupify!,Hermione Granger
4623,Harry!,Hermione Granger
4627,"Come on, let's go in to the feast.",Hermione Granger
4630,"Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are.",Hermione Granger
4647,What's that ?,Hermione Granger
4751,Was that an owl I heard?,Hermione Granger
4753,Really?,Hermione Granger
4756,Harry!,Hermione Granger
4762,"A few days ago.  Though... for a bit, I wasn't sure I was coming.",Hermione Granger
4765,She's not alone.  Even my parents -- and they're Muggles -- know something bad is happening.,Hermione Granger
4768,There's been a lot of chatter lately.  That he's gotten... old.,Hermione Granger
4792,These are adorable.,Hermione Granger
4805,How is it Fred and George are doing it?  Half the alley's closed down.,Hermione Granger
4808,Oh no.  Look.,Hermione Granger
4809,But everyone got their wands from Ollivander.  Young.  Old...,Hermione Granger
4818,Sorry.,Hermione Granger
4820,I don't know.,Hermione Granger
4827,"Stop, Harry, I know where you're going with this --",Hermione Granger
4830,Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.,Hermione Granger
4835,I told you.  I don't know what I saw.,Hermione Granger
4844,Where's Harry?,Hermione Granger
4877,Will.  You.  Stop.  Eating!  Your best friend is missing!,Hermione Granger
4881,"Where've you been, Harry?  And what happened to your face?",Hermione Granger
4885,What's happened to his hand?,Hermione Granger
4910,"Granger, sir.  That one there is Veritaserum.  And that would be Polyjuice Potion.  And that is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world.",Hermione Granger
4911,"It's rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them.  For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste --",Hermione Granger
4917,Liquid luck.,Hermione Granger
4925,How did you do that?,Hermione Granger
4927,No.  The instructions specifically say to cut.,Hermione Granger
4929,Sh!,Hermione Granger
5005,He's vile.,Hermione Granger
5007,No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.,Hermione Granger
5010,"I'd like to know just whose book that was.  Let's take a look, shall we?",Hermione Granger
5012,Why not?,Hermione Granger
5014,The binding is fragile?,Hermione Granger
5016,The who?,Hermione Granger
5019,"For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?",Hermione Granger
5022,"Well, I was curious.  So I went to",Hermione Granger
5026,And... nothing.  There's no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.,Hermione Granger
5029,"What've you got there, Hagrid?",Hermione Granger
5031,"Stinksap?  You're not sick, are you?",Hermione Granger
5036,"The Aurors. I know they're here to protect us, but... somehow I don't feel any safer.",Hermione Granger
5044,"Three Butterbeers.  Splash of ginger in mine, please.",Hermione Granger
5046,"Oh, honestly, Ronald.  They're just holding hands...",Hermione Granger
5047,And snogging.,Hermione Granger
5049,Leave?  You can't be serious.,Hermione Granger
5051,So?  What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me?  Would you expect her to get up and leave?,Hermione Granger
5060,"Be delighted, sir.",Hermione Granger
5069,What's up?,Hermione Granger
5072,I'll get someone --,Hermione Granger
5117,My parents are dentists.  They tend to people's teeth.,Hermione Granger
5119,"No.  Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches.",Hermione Granger
5123,Look at her eyes.  They've been fighting again.  Her and Dean.,Hermione Granger
5125,Nothing.,Hermione Granger
5145,How was what?,Hermione Granger
5147,Dead boring.  Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.,Hermione Granger
5148,"Ol' Sluggy's having a Christmas do, you know.  And we're meant to bring someone...",Hermione Granger
5150,"Actually, I was going to ask you.",Hermione Granger
5152,Really.  But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --,Hermione Granger
5159,"Don't drink that, Ron!",Hermione Granger
5160,You could be expelled for that.,Hermione Granger
5166,Ron seems to be enjoying himself.,Hermione Granger
5168,"You shouldn't have done it, Harry.",Hermione Granger
5170,That was different.  It was tryouts.  This was an actual match --,Hermione Granger
5171,You didn't put it in? Ron only thought you did?,Hermione Granger
5172,Charms spell.  Just practicing.,Hermione Granger
5174,"How does it feel, Harry?  When you see Dean with Ginny? I know, Harry.  You're my best friend.  I see how you look at her.",Hermione Granger
5177,Oppugno!,Hermione Granger
5180,"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.  I really couldn't care less.  Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together?  Yes.  Of course, now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements.",Hermione Granger
5182,Yes.  Why?,Hermione Granger
5184,Why didn't I think of that?,Hermione Granger
5186,"Um... it's a surprise.  Besides, it's you we need to worry about. And you can't pick just anyone. See that girl over there.  That's Romilda Vane.  Rumor has it she's trying to slip you a love potion.",Hermione Granger
5188,"Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.  You know that, right?",Hermione Granger
5199,"Hm?  Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac.  Under the mistletoe.",Hermione Granger
5201,I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he's a menace.  He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.,Hermione Granger
5203,No thank you.,Hermione Granger
5205,"On second thought -- maybe it'll keep Cormac at bay.  Oh no, here he comes!",Hermione Granger
5282,"You have to realize who you are, Harry.",Hermione Granger
5284,Sorry. So tell me what Arthur said.,Hermione Granger
5286,What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?,Hermione Granger
5288,"He looks different, don't you think?  Draco.  Almost... ill.",Hermione Granger
5292,"Excuse me, I have to go vomit.",Hermione Granger
5329,"Dead. Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol' Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One.",Hermione Granger
5331,"You're going to have to persuade him somehow.  And now, I'm afraid, you've made it a lot harder.",Hermione Granger
5334,That's... not possible.  No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.,Hermione Granger
5398,I might ask you the same.,Hermione Granger
5400,I happen to be his... friend.,Hermione Granger
5402,"He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting.",Hermione Granger
5408,Oh shut up.,Hermione Granger
5409,Ron.  Stop.  You're making it snow.,Hermione Granger
5412,"Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don't believe it was a long conversation --",Hermione Granger
5414,"Does, doesn't she?  And you say you don't remember a thing from that night?  Not one thing?",Hermione Granger
5416,Right.  Boggled...,Hermione Granger
5417,That's Katie.  That's Katie Bell.,Hermione Granger
5441,Well?  How do you feel?,Hermione Granger
5443,"Now remember.  Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office.",Hermione Granger
5445,"What?  No, Harry -- you've got to go see Slughorn.  We have a plan --",Hermione Granger
5447,No.,Hermione Granger
5554,Harry.  It's time.,Hermione Granger
5556,If one wants it to be.  Why?,Hermione Granger
5559,"Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!",Hermione Granger
5563,What if there are?,Hermione Granger
5699,Dumbledore.,Hermione Granger
5702,Strange.  Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort's soul...,Hermione Granger
5705,"'To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.  I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.  I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.  R.A.B.'",Hermione Granger
5707,"Ron's okay with it, you know.  You and Ginny.  But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.",Hermione Granger
5709,We reckoned -- Ron and me.,Hermione Granger
5711,"I've always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you're really thick.",Hermione Granger
5712,"You don't honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry.",Hermione Granger
5714,Like that's going to happen.,Hermione Granger
5715,"Besides, he's barking.",Hermione Granger
5717,"Yes, but I'm exceptionally perceptive.",Hermione Granger
5719,Do you think we'll ever... come back?,Hermione Granger
5723,"Coming, Mum.",Hermione Granger
5729,Obliviate.,Hermione Granger
5730,Goodbye.,Hermione Granger
5807,I told you he'd take it well.,Hermione Granger
5829,"Harry, your eyesight really is awful.",Hermione Granger
5871,Really?,Hermione Granger
5931,"We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --",Hermione Granger
5945,To Harry!  It belongs to Harry! It chose him!  It came to him in the Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it!,Hermione Granger
5951,"Where is your guard, sir?",Hermione Granger
5996,Ron!  Ron!,Hermione Granger
5999,Shaftesbury Avenue.  I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad.  Just popped into my head.  I don't know why...,Hermione Granger
6000,This way!,Hermione Granger
6001,We need to change.,Hermione Granger
6003,Undetectable Extension Charm.,Hermione Granger
6005,Always the tone of surprise.,Hermione Granger
6006,That'll be the books.,Hermione Granger
6009,"Ron's right.  Cappuccino, please.",Hermione Granger
6014,"Too dangerous.  If Voldemort's taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.",Hermione Granger
6017,I've had the essentials packed for days.  Just in case.,Hermione Granger
6021,Petrificus Totalus! Go.,Hermione Granger
6022,She doesn't argue.,Hermione Granger
6031,Obliviate.,Hermione Granger
6033,Maybe you still have the Trace on you.,Hermione Granger
6036,"We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.  Ginny and I -- we'd prepared a cake.  We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding...",Hermione Granger
6038,Right.  Perspective.,Hermione Granger
6044,"Mad-eye's doing, I'd guess.  In case Snape decided to come snooping.",Hermione Granger
6045,Homenum revelio.,Hermione Granger
6046,It's a spell to reveal human presence.,Hermione Granger
6047,We're alone.,Hermione Granger
6051,Harry!  Harry!,Hermione Granger
6052,Ron!  I've found him!,Hermione Granger
6054,"Harry, you can't just disappear. We thought --",Hermione Granger
6055,It's from your Mum.  To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...?,Hermione Granger
6057,Did she now?,Hermione Granger
6059,"Harry.  I can imagine why you'd want to go there, but... I don't think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes.",Hermione Granger
6062,Lovely.,Hermione Granger
6065,"Yes.  Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?",Hermione Granger
6070,Maybe he knows.,Hermione Granger
6077,But was it here?  Did you ever see it?,Hermione Granger
6080,Ron!  RON!,Hermione Granger
6093,They have flesh memories.,Hermione Granger
6094,"Snitches.  They're never touched by bare skin until the Seeker captures it.  Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves.  That way, if there's a dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it.",Hermione Granger
6096,"When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch -- that Dumbledore had hidden something in it.",Hermione Granger
6098,Expelliarmus!,Hermione Granger
6108,Stop lying!,Hermione Granger
6112,You've still got it.,Hermione Granger
6118,"Well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt...",Hermione Granger
6119,Remember what we said.  Keep your eyes down.  Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.  Act as normal as possible.  Just do what you see everyone else doing. We do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves inside. And then...,Hermione Granger
6121,Correct.,Hermione Granger
6123,"Completely, utterly, without question.",Hermione Granger
6126,"Mafalda Hopkirk, assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office.",Hermione Granger
6128,You're somebody.  Be careful.,Hermione Granger
6135,Muggles.  In their rightful place.,Hermione Granger
6137,You appear to be quite popular.,Hermione Granger
6142,I didn't.,Hermione Granger
6153,Try Finite Incantatem.  Of course if something's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm --,Hermione Granger
6155,This is you.,Hermione Granger
6157,I don't like him being on his own down there.,Hermione Granger
6159,"You really have horrible teeth, you know that.",Hermione Granger
6199,Relashio!,Hermione Granger
6203,Harry... they've seen you.  We've got to get out of here.,Hermione Granger
6210,"Harry, quickly, in my bag, there's a small bottle labeled 'Essence of Dittany.'",Hermione Granger
6211,Quickly!,Hermione Granger
6213,Unstopper it.,Hermione Granger
6215,Just do it!,Hermione Granger
6217,"We were.  We were there.  But Yaxley had hold of me.  I knew we couldn't stay once he'd seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got Splinched.  I'm... sorry.",Hermione Granger
6219,It's all I feel safe doing.,Hermione Granger
6220,Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...,Hermione Granger
6222,"Protective enchantments.  I don't fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent...",Hermione Granger
6224,Repello Muggletum... Muffliato...,Hermione Granger
6225,How're the mushrooms?  Seem to be the only edible things growing round here.,Hermione Granger
6227,Make sure to leave some for Ron.,Hermione Granger
6230,"He'll be alright in a few days. Hopefully.  If we could take him to Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey --",Hermione Granger
6231,So where do we go next?,Hermione Granger
6233,"It scares me a bit, that, thinking it's a piece of Vol--",Hermione Granger
6238,Dinner?,Hermione Granger
6240,Tea?,Hermione Granger
6244,I hate it.  It's like he's here with us.,Hermione Granger
6247,Incendio!,Hermione Granger
6249,Confringo!,Hermione Granger
6251,What're you doing?,Hermione Granger
6253,I can put it in my bag --,Hermione Granger
6260,I thought it had stopped.,Hermione Granger
6261,"You can't let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it.  You have to close your mind.  It's too dangerous --",Hermione Granger
6263,Tell me. What you saw.,Hermione Granger
6266,The wandmaker?,Hermione Granger
6268,Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch.  Most Durmstrang students did at one time.  What's he got to do with You-Know-Who?,Hermione Granger
6270,Don't -- It... comforts him.,Hermione Granger
6272,I think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news.  It gets him through the day.,Hermione Granger
6274,"We've all made sacrifices, Harry.",Hermione Granger
6276,I don't know.  It takes time.  I'm doing all I can.,Hermione Granger
6278,Take it off.,Hermione Granger
6279,Take it off.  Now.,Hermione Granger
6280,Better?,Hermione Granger
6282,It's cold.  Even though it's been lying against your skin for days.,Hermione Granger
6283,We'll take turns.  Okay?,Hermione Granger
6287,He could smell it.  My perfume.,Hermione Granger
6289,I told you.  Ron's not strong enough to Apparate.,Hermione Granger
6295,No one can conjure food out of thin air.  Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law.  The other four are --,Hermione Granger
6299,Good plan.,Hermione Granger
6303,None of us do.,Hermione Granger
6305,I don't like this place.,Hermione Granger
6306,I want to go.,Hermione Granger
6307,I'll tell you in a minute.,Hermione Granger
6309,Alright.  The Sword of Gryffindor? It's Goblin made.,Hermione Granger
6311,You don't understand.  Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger.,Hermione Granger
6313,"Harry.  You already destroyed one Horcrux, right?  Tom Riddle's diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets.",Hermione Granger
6315,"Don't you see!  In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor.",Hermione Granger
6316,Its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom.,Hermione Granger
6318,Exactly!  Which means...,Hermione Granger
6320,Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.,Hermione Granger
6322,"Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.",Hermione Granger
6330,Ron...,Hermione Granger
6337,"Take it off, Ron.  Please take it off.  You wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day --",Hermione Granger
6339,"Harry, we weren't --",Hermione Granger
6341,I didn't!  Not like that!  Harry -- I didn't!,Hermione Granger
6344,Stop!  Stop!,Hermione Granger
6347,Me?,Hermione Granger
6350,"What?  Ron, no -- please --",Hermione Granger
6351,He's gone.,Hermione Granger
6353,It's a Muggle station.,Hermione Granger
6355,'I open at the close?',Hermione Granger
6357,"I don't know.  But look, I've found something as well...",Hermione Granger
6358,"I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don't think it is. It isn't a rune and it's not in Spellman's Syllabary either.  And it's been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn't part of the book.",Hermione Granger
6360,What d'you mean -- wearing it?,Hermione Granger
6362,Why would someone have drawn it in a children's book?,Hermione Granger
6364,And it's exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you.,Hermione Granger
6366,"It's dangerous, Harry.  But I have to admit, recently even I've been thinking we might have to go.  I think it's possible something else is hidden there. The sword.  If Dumbledore didn't want it falling into the Ministry's hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?",Hermione Granger
6368,"Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?",Hermione Granger
6371,Don't ever let me give you a haircut again.,Hermione Granger
6372,I still think we should've used Polyjuice Potion.,Hermione Granger
6374,"Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve! Listen...",Hermione Granger
6376,Yeah. I think they would.,Hermione Granger
6377,Harry.,Hermione Granger
6379,No.  But look.,Hermione Granger
6380,Did you know he had a sister?,Hermione Granger
6382,Lumos.,Hermione Granger
6383,"Ignotus... Hey, Har --",Hermione Granger
6385,"Happy Christmas, Harry.",Hermione Granger
6386,Harry...,Hermione Granger
6388,Someone's watching us.  By the gate.,Hermione Granger
6390,I don't think this is a good idea.,Hermione Granger
6392,Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave.,Hermione Granger
6394,Omigod.  Harry...,Hermione Granger
6397,"Harry, I'm not sure about this.",Hermione Granger
6399,There's something odd about her. And what's that smell?,Hermione Granger
6402,"You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot.",Hermione Granger
6407,All right...,Hermione Granger
6409,Why?,Hermione Granger
6411,Harry...,Hermione Granger
6416,Harry!,Hermione Granger
6417,Confringo!,Hermione Granger
6418,"Harry... Harry, can you hear me...?",Hermione Granger
6420,Good.  That's good...,Hermione Granger
6422,Yes.,Hermione Granger
6424,I'm fine.  But you've been sick. Rest... Rest a bit more...,Hermione Granger
6426,"The Forest of Dean.  I came here once with my mum and dad, years ago.  It's just how I remember it. The trees.  The river.  It's like nothing's changed.  Not true, of course.  Everything's changed.  If I brought my parents here, they wouldn't recognize any of it.  Not the trees.  Not the river.  Not... me.",Hermione Granger
6428,"Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney, Australia.  They have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily.  No children.",Hermione Granger
6429,"Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.  Grow old.",Hermione Granger
6430,"You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.  Well, I know.",Hermione Granger
6431,"It was in Bathilda's sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her. Harry, it doesn't make for very nice reading --",Hermione Granger
6433,Yes.,Hermione Granger
6435,For a time.,Hermione Granger
6437,"Gellert Grindelwald.  He's not very well known in Britain, but there was a time, before You-Know- Who...",Hermione Granger
6439,"When Grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from Durmstrang. He'd started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. A few teachers had always protected him, but they couldn't anymore.  After he left, he traveled for awhile, then ended up in Godric's Hollow where his great aunt lived, Bathilda Bagshot.",Hermione Granger
6441,"She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense.  Dumbledore's mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they'd never really had anyone they could talk to on the same level.  They did a lot of talking that summer.  But they always returned to one particular subject.",Hermione Granger
6442,Wizard rule over Muggles.,Hermione Granger
6444,Yes.,Hermione Granger
6446,"It was something Dumbledore came up with.  He believed wizards were superior and should rule over Muggles, but gently, for their own good.  Grindelwald took a more violent position.",Hermione Granger
6447,"It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer.  Dumbledore was young --",Hermione Granger
6449,"He changed, Harry.  Years later, it was Dumbledore who put Grindelwald in prison.",Hermione Granger
6452,"It's my fault.  As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I'm sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --",Hermione Granger
6454,Maybe we can --,Hermione Granger
6457,"He loved you, Harry.  I know he loved you.",Hermione Granger
6487,"Who could look at you beside Harry Potter?  What are you, compared with the Chosen One...?",Hermione Granger
6490,"Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him...",Hermione Granger
6499,Everything all right?,Hermione Granger
6503,"You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!  You crawl back here after all these weeks and say, 'Hey?' Where's my wand?  Harry, where's my wand!",Hermione Granger
6505,"Harry Potter, you give me my wand!",Hermione Granger
6507,Never mind why he's got my wand --,Hermione Granger
6508,What is that?,Hermione Granger
6509,You destroyed it?,Hermione Granger
6511,Don't think this changes anything.,Hermione Granger
6513,See me doing what things?,Hermione Granger
6514,What happened out there?,Hermione Granger
6523,And what may I ask did I say?,Hermione Granger
6541,What's going on in there?,Hermione Granger
6545,We need to talk.,Hermione Granger
6547,I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.,Hermione Granger
6549,See this?  It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.  It's the mark again.,Hermione Granger
6550,It keeps cropping up.  Here.  In Beedle the Bard.  In the graveyard in Godric's Hollow -- what?,Hermione Granger
6552,Where?,Hermione Granger
6555,"Harry, you don't have a clue where the next Horcrux is.  And neither do I.  But this, this means something.  I'm sure of it.",Hermione Granger
6559,I'm always mad at him.,Hermione Granger
6562,Luna.,Hermione Granger
6575,Do you see that?,Hermione Granger
6577,No!  Don't go near it!,Hermione Granger
6578,It's an Erumpent horn.  It's a Class B Tradeable Material.,Hermione Granger
6581,"Where is Luna, sir?",Hermione Granger
6589,The what?,Hermione Granger
6591,Yes.,Hermione Granger
6594,It's in here.,Hermione Granger
6596,"Granger.  Well... all right. There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight --",Hermione Granger
6598,"In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass...",Hermione Granger
6604,"Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?",Hermione Granger
6609,"It's obvious, isn't it?",Hermione Granger
6611,The Cloak.,Hermione Granger
6614,Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered.,Hermione Granger
6616,"Why the Stone, Harry?",Hermione Granger
6618,But according to the story they don't want to come back.  It's all rubbish anyway.  There's no such thing as the Deathly Hallows.,Hermione Granger
6620,There have always been Cloaks --,Hermione Granger
6623,"Mr. Lovegood.  Thank you, sir --",Hermione Granger
6628,"No matter, sir.  We really ought to be go--",Hermione Granger
6636,Ron!  Harry!  Take my hand!,Hermione Granger
6648,What're you saying?,Hermione Granger
6651,Stop it!,Hermione Granger
6664,Penelope Clearwater.  Half-blood.,Hermione Granger
6671,A Stinging Jinx.,Hermione Granger
6673,Not long.,Hermione Granger
6690,I didn't take anything. Please. I didn't take anything.,Hermione Granger
6694,Please! please!,Hermione Granger
6764,"Harry, are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?",Hermione Granger
6789,Positive. Harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed Ollivander -- and extends the longest to Hermione.,Hermione Granger
6792,But I hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...,Hermione Granger
6797,"It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --",Hermione Granger
6800,"It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur.",Hermione Granger
6833,He's right. I was being stupid.,Hermione Granger
6873,It looks like it's been down here forever.,Hermione Granger
6876,That's barbaric. I...,Hermione Granger
6882,Lumos !,Hermione Granger
6884,Look.,Hermione Granger
6885,No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.,Hermione Granger
6887,"It's hot! All eyes turn to the bowl, WOBBLING MADLY on the floor, when... it SPLITS APART and begins to MULTIPLY.",Hermione Granger
6888,"Ron, your foot!",Hermione Granger
6891,How're we going to reach it?,Hermione Granger
6894,Harry! Behind you!,Hermione Granger
6896,In here!,Hermione Granger
6903,We can't just stand here! Who's got an idea?,Hermione Granger
6905,I've got something. But it's mad.,Hermione Granger
6906,Relashio!,Hermione Granger
6909,It doesn't realize it's free!,Hermione Granger
6914,When?,Hermione Granger
6917,How is it you --,Hermione Granger
6919,"You let him in! Harry, you can't --",Hermione Granger
6925,What?,Hermione Granger
6927,You saw it?,Hermione Granger
6928,Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what --,Hermione Granger
6935,They were ready for us.,Hermione Granger
6939,"No, you'll give us away.",Hermione Granger
6943,I know.,Hermione Granger
6944,Harry! I can see you! In here!,Hermione Granger
6955,Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?,Hermione Granger
6974,"That's Ariana, isn't it? Your sister. She's beautiful.",Hermione Granger
6976,"She died very young, didn't she.",Hermione Granger
6978,Mr. Dumbledore... thank you.,Hermione Granger
6979,"Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn't seem like someone who's given up, does it?",Hermione Granger
6980,She's coming back! And she's got someone with her!,Hermione Granger
6989,"How bad is it, Neville? With Snape as Headmaster.",Hermione Granger
6993,They did that to you? But why?,Hermione Granger
7050,Unless we can destroy it.,Hermione Granger
7052,You were thinking. It's Ron's idea. And it's brilliant.,Hermione Granger
7055,Where are you going?,Hermione Granger
7091,No. Of course not.,Hermione Granger
7093,I'm scared.,Hermione Granger
7095,Not this.,Hermione Granger
7141,There he is.,Hermione Granger
7143,He vanished. Just now. I saw it. Ron glances at MAP -- then:,Hermione Granger
7144,That's right. I did.,Hermione Granger
7146,Brilliant.,Hermione Granger
7162,Did you see where it went? The diadem!,Hermione Granger
7166,Do we climb!,Hermione Granger
7170,C'mon! This way!,Hermione Granger
7179,Someplace safe.,Hermione Granger
7219,Where is everyone?,Hermione Granger
7277,Where've you been?,Hermione Granger
7283,"What is it, Harry? What is it you",Hermione Granger
7286,I'll go with you. I/'ll --,Hermione Granger
7411,Yes!,Hermione Granger
7412,I don't want you to say anything you wouldn't say if we weren't about to be killed by a giant snake! It'll just ruin it!,Hermione Granger
7417,What's the matter with her?,Hermione Granger
7421,Can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.,Hermione Granger
7422,Something my mum used to say.,Hermione Granger
7423,Why didn't it work for him? The Elder wand.,Hermione Granger
7429,We?,Hermione Granger
7432,Don't forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.,Hermione Granger
