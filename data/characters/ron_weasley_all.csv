2817,"There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist.",Ron Weasley
2827,Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.,Ron Weasley
2846,Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.,Ron Weasley
2847,"On second thought, just the drewbals.",Ron Weasley
2849,"Just the drewbals, thanks.",Ron Weasley
2855,"Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.",Ron Weasley
2865,"Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!",Ron Weasley
2875,"Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.",Ron Weasley
2877,He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.,Ron Weasley
2894,Yes...,Ron Weasley
2896,"Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse.",Ron Weasley
2910,"Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know.",Ron Weasley
2915,"Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen.",Ron Weasley
2960,How did you do it?,Ron Weasley
2961,Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.,Ron Weasley
2963,You know bloody well what.,Ron Weasley
2965,"Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend.",Ron Weasley
2967,Piss off.,Ron Weasley
3006,Who you talking to?,Ron Weasley
3008,I heard voices.,Ron Weasley
3010,You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.,Ron Weasley
3055,You think so?,Ron Weasley
3057,Anything else?,Ron Weasley
3059,Fine.,Ron Weasley
3112,I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.,Ron Weasley
3114,Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.,Ron Weasley
3116,At least I warned you about the dragons.,Ron Weasley
3118,"Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out.",Ron Weasley
3120,Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.,Ron Weasley
3124,Thank you Nigel.,Ron Weasley
3125,Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.,Ron Weasley
3126,I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??,Ron Weasley
3128,Ginny these must be for you.,Ron Weasley
3130,What are you on about?,Ron Weasley
3132,Dress robes? for what?,Ron Weasley
3137,Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan.,Ron Weasley
3140,Where?,Ron Weasley
3150,"Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?",Ron Weasley
3154,This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.,Ron Weasley
3155,"Well, us and Neville!",Ron Weasley
3158,Now I'm really depressed.,Ron Weasley
3159,"Well Hermione, you're a girl.",Ron Weasley
3161,Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.,Ron Weasley
3163,Bloody hell.,Ron Weasley
3164,"Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?",Ron Weasley
3184,"There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out.",Ron Weasley
3187,What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.,Ron Weasley
3191,Bloody hell.,Ron Weasley
3192,What are those??,Ron Weasley
3194,"Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar.",Ron Weasley
3196,Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.,Ron Weasley
3197,I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.,Ron Weasley
3199,"Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out.",Ron Weasley
3201,"Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?",Ron Weasley
3203,Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud.,Ron Weasley
3214,No. Absolutely not.,Ron Weasley
3219,"No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.",Ron Weasley
3221,He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.,Ron Weasley
3223,"Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.",Ron Weasley
3225,No.,Ron Weasley
3226,He's using you.,Ron Weasley
3228,Doubt it. He's way too old.,Ron Weasley
3230,Yeah that is what I think.,Ron Weasley
3232,Go on.,Ron Weasley
3234,Well that's completely off the point. Harry...,Ron Weasley
3236,They get scary when they get older.,Ron Weasley
3304,Well... yeah... a bit,Ron Weasley
3305,Merci.,Ron Weasley
3314,Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.,Ron Weasley
3320,We're still misfits.,Ron Weasley
3486,Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?,Ron Weasley
3492,Well I won't. You know I won't!,Ron Weasley
3601,"Let him breathe, Hermione!",Ron Weasley
3603,"Good to see you, mate.",Ron Weasley
3606,"We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted. There is an awkward silence.",Ron Weasley
3608,He thought you would be safest there.,Ron Weasley
3612,"We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy.",Ron Weasley
3614,"It's not that fun, mate. Mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings.",Ron Weasley
3617,"We've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings. But we do know a few things.",Ron Weasley
3666,What does he get a hug for?,Ron Weasley
3667,"Oh, sure, that's why.",Ron Weasley
3668,"Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all...",Ron Weasley
3777,"Come on, lets go back downstairs!",Ron Weasley
3787,What if he were still on his...,Ron Weasley
3788,What if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore?,Ron Weasley
3835,You reckon she's here to spy on us?,Ron Weasley
3841,"Well, Harry, shall we start on Snape's report?",Ron Weasley
3857,Harry! I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts! I'm on the team!,Ron Weasley
3858,Harry--bloody hell!,Ron Weasley
3860,You said she was making you do lines!,Ron Weasley
3871,Always knew she was a bit fishy.,Ron Weasley
3894,"""The Hog's Head,"" Hermione?",Ron Weasley
3922,Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn't kill you!,Ron Weasley
3948,She can't!,Ron Weasley
3950,Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her.,Ron Weasley
3955,She doesn't look very good.,Ron Weasley
4010,I'm going to resign.,Ron Weasley
4012,I'm horrible! I should never have joined.,Ron Weasley
4014,This is the worst day of my life.,Ron Weasley
4019,"Come off it, Hagrid! We're not blind!",Ron Weasley
4023,A month?,Ron Weasley
4026,So...no giants are coming?,Ron Weasley
4032,Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself.,Ron Weasley
4043,Get McGonagall! Go!,Ron Weasley
4044,Harry! HARRY!,Ron Weasley
4111,So you're saying this weapon You- Know-Who's after is in the Department of Mysteries?,Ron Weasley
4115,But why the Department of Mysteries?,Ron Weasley
4118,Bloody hell!,Ron Weasley
4165,"No way. Quidditch practice. If I don't show up, Angelina'll go mad.",Ron Weasley
4244,You all right?,Ron Weasley
4249,To the Department of Mysteries?,Ron Weasley
4252,Yeah. They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic!,Ron Weasley
4344,"Shut up, Malfoy!",Ron Weasley
4347,Stupify!,Ron Weasley
4355,That's just what we were wondering.,Ron Weasley
4356,"So, how do we get to the Ministry?",Ron Weasley
4362,What are what?,Ron Weasley
4367,And what about those of us who can't see them? Luna comes over to them.,Ron Weasley
4369,Never again...,Ron Weasley
4388,"What do you mean, people?",Ron Weasley
4397,"Harry, have you seen this?",Ron Weasley
4398,Er...it's got your name on it.,Ron Weasley
4460,"Hiyya, Harry.",Ron Weasley
4625,"Good as new, mate.",Ron Weasley
4649,Yeah ?,Ron Weasley
4748,Harry?  Did someone say Harry?,Ron Weasley
4750,"'Course not.  Think I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?",Ron Weasley
4755,Harry!,Ron Weasley
4760,You've a bit of...,Ron Weasley
4763,Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.  That it's too dangerous.,Ron Weasley
4766,"Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy.  Took a day or two, but she came round.",Ron Weasley
4770,A hundred and fifty.  Give or take a few years.,Ron Weasley
4794,How much for this?,Ron Weasley
4797,How much for me?,Ron Weasley
4800,But I'm your brother!,Ron Weasley
4802,C'mon. Let's go.,Ron Weasley
4804,Hi.,Ron Weasley
4806,Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.,Ron Weasley
4811,Is it just me?  Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed?,Ron Weasley
4812,What're they playing at?,Ron Weasley
4814,Hey.  Where's Hermione?,Ron Weasley
4815,"Harry, where is she?",Ron Weasley
4817,Bloody hell.,Ron Weasley
4829,One of what?,Ron Weasley
4831,You're barking.  What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?,Ron Weasley
4833,It's a creepy shop.  He's a creepy bloke.,Ron Weasley
4845,Probably on the platform.  C'mon.,Ron Weasley
4876,Don' you worry.  He'll be 'long soon 'nuff --,Ron Weasley
4878,"Oi!  Turn around, you lunatic.",Ron Weasley
4880,Looks like his own this time.,Ron Weasley
4883,"Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say -- it's a hat, isn't it?  First Years seemed to enjoy it, though. Wankers. Filch give you the wand outside?",Ron Weasley
4892,That was cheerful.,Ron Weasley
4903,But I don't want to take Potions!,Ron Weasley
4905,"Ron Weasley, sir.  But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --",Ron Weasley
4993,Hard feelings?,Ron Weasley
4995,"Really?  Strapping guy like you, you've got a Beater's build, don't you think?  Keeper needs to be agile, quick --",Ron Weasley
5003,"Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one.  Hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.",Ron Weasley
5004,"Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione.  Cormac.",Ron Weasley
5008,"Not bloody likely.  He's top of the class.  Even better than you, Hermione.  Slughorn thinks he's a genius.",Ron Weasley
5009,What?,Ron Weasley
5017,The who?,Ron Weasley
5021,"Yeah. Right. Well, it's true.  I like a nice chat before I go to bed.  Now you're always reading that bloody book.  It's like being with Hermione.",Ron Weasley
5024,The library.,Ron Weasley
5033,Spider?  About six feet tall?  Ten feet wide?,Ron Weasley
5035,Barking.  Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What?,Ron Weasley
5042,O-kay.,Ron Weasley
5045,"Aw, bloody hell...",Ron Weasley
5048,I'd like to leave.,Ron Weasley
5050,That happens to be my sister.,Ron Weasley
5062,What're you playing at?,Ron Weasley
5064,Get to know him?,Ron Weasley
5066,Um... You've got a little...,Ron Weasley
5067,Bit worried about her.  Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub?  Her and me snogging.  Ha.  As if...,Ron Weasley
5071,"Harry, she's swallowing her tongue --",Ron Weasley
5081,"Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.",Ron Weasley
5093,What do you suppose Dean sees in her?  Ginny.,Ron Weasley
5095,Dean?  He's brilliant.,Ron Weasley
5097,"Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?  Something snaps.  You've got to hate him.  You know, on principle.",Ron Weasley
5099,So what is it?  He sees in her?,Ron Weasley
5101,Attractive?,Ron Weasley
5103,Skin?  You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?,Ron Weasley
5105,"Hermione's got nice skin. Wouldn't you say?  As skin goes, I mean.",Ron Weasley
5108,Right.,Ron Weasley
5144,So.  How was it?,Ron Weasley
5146,Your dinner party.,Ron Weasley
5149,I expect you'll be going with McLaggen.  Isn't he a member of the Slug Club?,Ron Weasley
5151,Really?,Ron Weasley
5154,I'm resigning.  After today's match.  McLaggen can have my spot.,Ron Weasley
5156,Sure...,Ron Weasley
5162,"C'mon, Harry.  We've got a game to win.",Ron Weasley
5176,What's with the birds?,Ron Weasley
5179,"Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.  What Lav and I have -- well, let's just say there was no stopping it.  It's chemical.  Will it last?  Who knows?  Point is, I'm a free agent.",Ron Weasley
5228,Unbreakable Vow.  You're sure that's what Snape said.,Ron Weasley
5230,"It's just, well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow.",Ron Weasley
5232,"No, you don't understand -- Oh, bloody hell...",Ron Weasley
5234,All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.,Ron Weasley
5237,You die.,Ron Weasley
5290,"Lav, c'mon. Of course I'll wear it.",Ron Weasley
5336,"It's beautiful, isn't it?  The moon.",Ron Weasley
5338,It was on your bed.  The box. Thought I'd try one...,Ron Weasley
5340,"I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.",Ron Weasley
5342,She could never annoy me.  I think... I think I love her.,Ron Weasley
5345,Do you think she knows I exist?,Ron Weasley
5347,Snogging?  Who're you talking about?,Ron Weasley
5349,"Romilda, of course.  Romilda Vane.",Ron Weasley
5352,It's no joke!  I'm in love with her!,Ron Weasley
5354,No.  Can you introduce me?,Ron Weasley
5356,How do I look?,Ron Weasley
5361,Where's Romilda?,Ron Weasley
5366,"Hello, darling.  Fancy a drink?",Ron Weasley
5375,What's this?,Ron Weasley
5377,What happened to me?,Ron Weasley
5380,I feel really... bad.,Ron Weasley
5388,"These girls are gonna kill me, Harry.",Ron Weasley
5404,Er... My... Nee... Er!  My!  Nee!,Ron Weasley
5410,Huh?,Ron Weasley
5411,Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?,Ron Weasley
5413,Don't get me wrong.  I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.  It's just she seems... a bit put out.,Ron Weasley
5415,"Well... there is... something. But no.  It can't be.  Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn't I?",Ron Weasley
5435,So.  Did you and Ginny do it?,Ron Weasley
5437,You know.  Hide the book.,Ron Weasley
5439,"Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?",Ron Weasley
5448,No.,Ron Weasley
5560,No.  I got an owl from Dad this morning.  The one at Borgin & Burke's?  It's still there.,Ron Weasley
5565,"Good luck, mate.",Ron Weasley
5731,What are those?,Ron Weasley
5734,C'mon.  Mum's got dinner ready.,Ron Weasley
5809,"Never done that before, have we?",Ron Weasley
5828,I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo.,Ron Weasley
5869,Hey ya -- Well... thanks.,Ron Weasley
5872,Always the tone of surprise.,Ron Weasley
5896,Going somewhere?,Ron Weasley
5898,"For you?  You think Madeye died for you?  You think George took that curse for you?  You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that.",Ron Weasley
5900,And leave Hermione?  Are you mad? We wouldn't last two days without her.,Ron Weasley
5901,"Don't tell her I said that. Besides, you've still got the Trace on you.  And there's the wedding...",Ron Weasley
5903,"Bill and Fleur.  Mum's been planning it for months.  Only thing that's kept her sane, I reckon.  She'll kill me if I miss it.  Kill you too.  Rather go face to face with You-Know-Who if I'm honest.",Ron Weasley
5905,"Tonight's not the night, mate. You'd only be doing him a favor.",Ron Weasley
5906,Do you think he knows?,Ron Weasley
5907,"I mean, they're bits of his soul, the Horcruxes.  Bits of him.  When Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary all those years ago -- he must've felt something right?",Ron Weasley
5908,"What I'm saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one...",Ron Weasley
5909,Won't he know he's being hunted?,Ron Weasley
5924,Dunno.  But something tells me he didn't come to give away the bride.,Ron Weasley
5929,Dumbledore?  And me?  I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley to him.  He was always polite --,Ron Weasley
5937,Dumbledore left this?  For me? Brilliant.  Er -- what is it?,Ron Weasley
5938,Wicked.,Ron Weasley
5940,"Mum used to read me those!  The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty Rabbity and her Cackling Stump...",Ron Weasley
5941,"Oh, c'mon!  Beedle's stories are famous!  Babbity Rabbitty? No...?",Ron Weasley
5998,Where are we?,Ron Weasley
6002,How the ruddy --,Ron Weasley
6004,"You're amazing, you are.",Ron Weasley
6008,"They were after you, mate.  We'd just put everyone in danger going back.",Ron Weasley
6010,What she said.,Ron Weasley
6013,So where do we go from here?  The Leaky Cauldron?,Ron Weasley
6018,By the way -- these jeans?  Not my favorite.  Bit tight.,Ron Weasley
6025,This is Dolohov.  I recognize him from the wanted posters.,Ron Weasley
6026,"So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?",Ron Weasley
6027,Suppose it's him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then?,Ron Weasley
6029,You're the boss. Hermione?,Ron Weasley
6030,You're the best with spells.,Ron Weasley
6034,Can't be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It's Wizarding law.,Ron Weasley
6035,What?,Ron Weasley
6039,"We've got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.",Ron Weasley
6043,What was that about?,Ron Weasley
6053,Good!  Tell him from me he's a git!,Ron Weasley
6060,Hey!  I think you two better come down here.,Ron Weasley
6061,"The two clinging to the tree are Death Eaters for sure.  Dunno 'bout the bloke on the bench. Can't see us, of course.  But we'll have to be careful coming and going.  C'mon.  There's something else you need to see.",Ron Weasley
6064,R.A.B. was Sirius' brother?,Ron Weasley
6067,Kreacher...,Ron Weasley
6104,"You're a thief, Dung.  Everyone knows it.",Ron Weasley
6106,Wicked trainers.,Ron Weasley
6109,Piece of advice.  Let's not rehash old times.  Got it... mate?,Ron Weasley
6113,No.  He's worried he should have got more money for it.,Ron Weasley
6117,Right. So let's do it.  Who gets who?,Ron Weasley
6124,"The world's mental.  Come on, drink up.  We've got a Horcrux to find.",Ron Weasley
6125,"In case you're interested, I'm Reg Cattermole, Magical Maintenance Department.",Ron Weasley
6130,Oh... yeah.  Thanks.,Ron Weasley
6131,What do you reckon he meant by 'Good luck.'?,Ron Weasley
6133,That's bloody disgusting.,Ron Weasley
6138,"I gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit.",Ron Weasley
6140,They're not Ministry.  They're Snatchers.  They hunt Muggle-borns and blood-traitors for a price.,Ron Weasley
6145,Really?  Have you tried an umbrella?,Ron Weasley
6147,Downstairs...?,Ron Weasley
6149,Oh my god.  What am I going to do? My wife's all alone downstairs?,Ron Weasley
6152,"No, that's mad.  You two find Umbridge.  I'll be fine.  But how do I stop it raining?",Ron Weasley
6156,"Finite Incantatem, okay.  And if that doesn't work...?",Ron Weasley
6170,M-morning.,Ron Weasley
6172,"Harry!  Blimey, I forgot what you looked like.  Where's Hermione?",Ron Weasley
6182,Bloody cold down here.,Ron Weasley
6184,What is it?,Ron Weasley
6201,"'Tis, isn't it?  This'll be one to tell the kids.",Ron Weasley
6204,"Mary.  Go home.  Get the kids. I'll... I'll meet you there.  We have to get out the country, understand?",Ron Weasley
6205,Mary!  Do as I say!,Ron Weasley
6206,I'm sorry.  It's just --,Ron Weasley
6207,Long story.  Nice meeting you.,Ron Weasley
6208,Piss off.,Ron Weasley
6234,"No, don't!  Don't say it!",Ron Weasley
6235,It's taboo -- You-Know-Who's name. That's how they track people now. It's how they found us in the cafe that night.,Ron Weasley
6237,"I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry.  Blimey, what's that smell?",Ron Weasley
6239,Not bloody likely.  Smells like something Ginny would cook.,Ron Weasley
6241,Is that it?,Ron Weasley
6243,... alive.,Ron Weasley
6250,It's angry.,Ron Weasley
6255,"Seems strange, mate.  Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn't bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn't that bother you?",Ron Weasley
6291,I'm hungry.,Ron Weasley
6293,Leave it.,Ron Weasley
6294,Mum can make food appear out of thin air.,Ron Weasley
6296,"Oh, speak English, can't you?",Ron Weasley
6297,I said leave it.,Ron Weasley
6300,"Yeah.  Brilliant.  Only, correct me if I'm wrong... wasn't that yesterday's plan?  And the day before that?  And the day before that?  Walk.  Sleep.  Walk. Sleep.",Ron Weasley
6302,"He doesn't know what he's doing, does he?",Ron Weasley
6304,Wizards were here.,Ron Weasley
6324,The sword was stolen.,Ron Weasley
6325,"Yeah, I'm still here.  But you two carry on.  Don't let me spoil your fun.",Ron Weasley
6327,"Problem?  There's no problem.  Not according to you, anyway.",Ron Weasley
6329,"All right, I'll spit it out. Don't expect me to skip up and down because now there's some other damn thing we've got to find.",Ron Weasley
6332,"Yeah, I thought I did too.",Ron Weasley
6334,"No, I just reckoned after all this time, we'd have actually achieved something.  I reckoned you knew what you were doing.  I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan!",Ron Weasley
6336,"Yeah, and we're about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we!",Ron Weasley
6340,"Don't lie!  You said it, too, you said you were disappointed --",Ron Weasley
6342,"Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night?  Do you!  To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name or Fred or George or Mum or --",Ron Weasley
6346,And you?,Ron Weasley
6348,Are you staying?  Or coming?,Ron Weasley
6349,"Fine.  I get it.  I saw you two the other night.  Yeah, that's right.  Didn't know I knew, did you?",Ron Weasley
6462,Are -- you -- mental?,Ron Weasley
6464,"Well, yeah.  Bit obvious, I'd think.",Ron Weasley
6466,No.  I reckoned it was you.,Ron Weasley
6468,Right.  Antlers.,Ron Weasley
6470,"No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --",Ron Weasley
6471,Anything?,Ron Weasley
6473,"And we did, didn't we?",Ron Weasley
6475,"What?  No.  Harry.  That thing's bad for me.  I can't handle it. I'm not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.  It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse.",Ron Weasley
6477,No.  I can't --,Ron Weasley
6493,I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I left.,Ron Weasley
6495,Saving your life.,Ron Weasley
6497,And just think of it.  Only three to go.,Ron Weasley
6501,Hey.,Ron Weasley
6502,Wo -- hey -- ouch!,Ron Weasley
6506,How come he's got your wand?,Ron Weasley
6512,"No, of course not.  I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux!  Why would that change anything!  Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you!  To see you doing those things --",Ron Weasley
6516,"Look, I wanted to come back the minute I'd left.  I just... didn't know how to find you.",Ron Weasley
6518,With this.,Ron Weasley
6519,"It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know exactly how it works, but Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I'd given some Snatchers the slip the night before, me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway, I was sleeping when I heard it...",Ron Weasley
6521,A voice.,Ron Weasley
6522,"Your voice, Hermione.  Coming out of this.",Ron Weasley
6524,My name.  Just my name.  Like a whisper.,Ron Weasley
6525,So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.  And I knew.,Ron Weasley
6527,"Just knew.  On account of Hermione's voice.  And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here.",Ron Weasley
6528,"I could feel it inside me.  It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea.  And I knew it would take me where I needed to go.",Ron Weasley
6529,So I Disapparated and came out on this hillside.  It was dark.  I didn't have any idea where I was. I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end. And you did.,Ron Weasley
6530,I've always liked it.  These flames Hermione makes.,Ron Weasley
6531,How long you reckon she'll stay mad at me?,Ron Weasley
6533,It was true.  Every word.,Ron Weasley
6534,"Bloody hell.  I just realized. You need a wand, right?",Ron Weasley
6536,"Well, I've got one.  Here.  It's Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.  I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back.",Ron Weasley
6537,"Don't tell Hermione, but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.  This one was definitely part Troll.  The smell off him...",Ron Weasley
6539,Wo.,Ron Weasley
6543,Nothing.,Ron Weasley
6544,"Maybe a bit more practice, eh?",Ron Weasley
6546,All right.,Ron Weasley
6554,But what does it mean?,Ron Weasley
6556,I think Hermione's right.  I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it?  Those in favor...,Ron Weasley
6557,"Sorry, Harry.  Looks like it's Hermione and me this time.",Ron Weasley
6560,Luna?,Ron Weasley
6563,Keep off the dirigible plums.,Ron Weasley
6571,Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry?,Ron Weasley
6574,"He's mental.  Let's face it. Luna's always good value, but she's nutty as squirrel poo.",Ron Weasley
6576,"Well, yeah, of course.  It's massive, isn't it?",Ron Weasley
6579,"Yeah, all right...",Ron Weasley
6588,The what?,Ron Weasley
6592,Yes.,Ron Weasley
6597,Midnight.  Mum always said midnight. But twilight's fine.  Better actually.,Ron Weasley
6607,"Let's get out of here once he's back.  I'm not touching this stuff, hot or cold.",Ron Weasley
6610,The Wand.,Ron Weasley
6613,"You're supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible.  Dead boring if you ask me.  But an unbeatable wand!",Ron Weasley
6615,"Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you'd lead.",Ron Weasley
6621,Not like Harry's.  I've seen a fair few.  Dad used to bring home the ones the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or tears. Harry's is different.  It's perfect.,Ron Weasley
6624,You forgot the water.,Ron Weasley
6626,For the tea.,Ron Weasley
6634,Nooooooooo!,Ron Weasley
6637,That treacherous old bleeder!  Is there no one we can trust!,Ron Weasley
6639,I'll do the enchantments.,Ron Weasley
6650,Don't touch her!,Ron Weasley
6657,Stan Shunpike.,Ron Weasley
6659,Weasley... Barney Weasley.,Ron Weasley
6661,Piss off!  Arthur Weasley's ten times the wizard you are!,Ron Weasley
6686,What are we gonna do? We can't leave Hermione alone with her.,Ron Weasley
6692,We have to do something.,Ron Weasley
6698,Let her go.,Ron Weasley
6705,Works for me.,Ron Weasley
6707,Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. Trust me.,Ron Weasley
6718,Like hell.,Ron Weasley
6719,Expellliarmus!,Ron Weasley
6745,Then you're on our side.,Ron Weasley
6756,Who put it there? The fake.,Ron Weasley
6766,And if we find one? How're we supposed to destroy it if we've given Griphook the sword?,Ron Weasley
6788,You're sure it's hers?,Ron Weasley
6791,You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now.,Ron Weasley
6794,"How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything.",Ron Weasley
6796,That's a bit scary.,Ron Weasley
6813,Always good value. I'll miss her.,Ron Weasley
6814,What d'you think?,Ron Weasley
6816,You want to tell me what that is?,Ron Weasley
6818,You mean he could see you?,Ron Weasley
6820,Go on.,Ron Weasley
6822,Bloody hell... that's a sight.,Ron Weasley
6824,Hideous.,Ron Weasley
6826,"Couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying --",Ron Weasley
6827,"Never mind. I'm good.  That is you in there, isn't it?",Ron Weasley
6831,Hey. Easy.,Ron Weasley
6842,What do you mean?,Ron Weasley
6846,"Harry, what do we do? Harry...?",Ron Weasley
6858,What's that? Up ahead.,Ron Weasley
6864,You don't say.  Just out of interest... is there any other way out of here?,Ron Weasley
6869,Imperio!,Ron Weasley
6871,No. It's not possible...,Ron Weasley
6872,Bloody hell. That's a Welsh Green.,Ron Weasley
6875,It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.,Ron Weasley
6881,Lumos !,Ron Weasley
6883,Blimey...,Ron Weasley
6886,"Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?",Ron Weasley
6893,Keep going!,Ron Weasley
6895,The cup!,Ron Weasley
6901,Foul little git. Least we've got Bogrod.,Ron Weasley
6902,That's unfortunate.,Ron Weasley
6904,You're asking us? You're the brilliant one.,Ron Weasley
6907,That's your idea?,Ron Weasley
6910,That was brilliant! BRILLIANT!,Ron Weasley
6911,Bloody hell.,Ron Weasley
6913,I say we jump!,Ron Weasley
6921,Never mind! What did you see?,Ron Weasley
6923,What happens when he finds out four are gone?,Ron Weasley
6926,What?,Ron Weasley
6930,'Fraid he's right. One problem: Snape's Headmaster now. We can't just walk in the front door.,Ron Weasley
6933,Maybe it's because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying.,Ron Weasley
6938,What's he mean by that?,Ron Weasley
6942,Did you get a look at him! Fora second I thought it was --,Ron Weasley
6981,Who's that with her? Bloody hell...,Ron Weasley
6987,I don't remember this being on the Marauder's Map.,Ron Weasley
7011,Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem?,Ron Weasley
7016,"Six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm Frankie First Year. I mean, I'm only her brother.",Ron Weasley
7018,"Shut up, Seamus.",Ron Weasley
7049,"Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn't really matter if we find the Horcrux.",Ron Weasley
7051,So we were thinking --,Ron Weasley
7053,"You destroyed Tom Riddle's Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don't we?",Ron Weasley
7090,Harry talks in his sleep. Haven't you noticed?,Ron Weasley
7092,I've never got this far before.,Ron Weasley
7094,Me too. Hermione: I didn't expect it to be like this.,Ron Weasley
7122,You do it.,Ron Weasley
7123,"Yes, you can.",Ron Weasley
7140,Bloody hell. We/'ll never find him on this.,Ron Weasley
7142,Brilliant.,Ron Weasley
7145,Let's go.,Ron Weasley
7164,RUN! Goyle's set the bioody place on fire!,Ron Weasley
7169,Serves him right.,Ron Weasley
7172,Brilliant.,Ron Weasley
7174,You're bloody well welcome!,Ron Weasley
7178,Where will he take her?,Ron Weasley
7181,"Look inside him, Harry.",Ron Weasley
7182,"Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we're one step closer to ending this.",Ron Weasley
7215,He's gone. The snake too.,Ron Weasley
7218,Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!,Ron Weasley
7278,"We thought you'd gone to the forest, we thought you might be --",Ron Weasley
7280,Are you mad! No!,Ron Weasley
7282,"Rubbish! You can't just give yourself up to him -- Hermione squeezes Ron's arm, silencing him.",Ron Weasley
7376,Liar!,Ron Weasley
7382,He saved your life.,Ron Weasley
7395,"Well done, Malfoy!",Ron Weasley
7410,Hermione!,Ron Weasley
7420,"Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?",Ron Weasley
7426,But that means...,Ron Weasley
7428,What do you reckon we should do with it?,Ron Weasley
