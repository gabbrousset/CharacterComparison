243,Albus Dumbledore,"I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students.

7338,Albus Dumbledore,True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?,mentoring
4699,Albus Dumbledore,"Wand out, Harry.",magic
2192,Albus Dumbledore,Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it. I'm quite convinced the castle is safe... and I'm more than willing to send the students back to their houses.,hogwarts academics
1804,Albus Dumbledore,"And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?",magical creatures
2178,Albus Dumbledore,"Dear lady, who did this to you?",threats
4939,Albus Dumbledore,And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction?,social dynamics
3478,Albus Dumbledore,"Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort. The ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. And we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end.",mentoring

1268,Albus Dumbledore,"We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution to all.",magic
4147,Albus Dumbledore,"Ah, yes. I was wondering when we'd hit that little snag.",strategy

4890,Albus Dumbledore,"Today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.

5648,Albus Dumbledore,"Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I'm curious.  When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?",threats
2046,Albus Dumbledore,"Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher... has decided to retire... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce... that his place will be taken by none other... than our own Rubeus Hagrid. Finally, on a more disquieting note... at the request of the Ministry of Magic... Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban... until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now whilst I've been assured... that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution. Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you... to give them no reason to harm you. It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But you know, happiness can be found... even in the darkest of times... if one only remembers to turn on the light.",threats

1806,Albus Dumbledore,"I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.",threats
7264,Albus Dumbledore,"Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely.",threats
3362,Albus Dumbledore,"Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.",strategy

In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points!  Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points!  And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house!  Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin.
