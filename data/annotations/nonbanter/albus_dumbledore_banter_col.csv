7263,You must agree.,Albus Dumbledore,1
243,"I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch  has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7351,"I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my",Albus Dumbledore,0
1445,Yes.,Albus Dumbledore,1
1369,"The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7338,True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?,Albus Dumbledore,0
4699,"Wand out, Harry.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2192,Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it. I'm quite convinced the castle is safe... and I'm more than willing to send the students back to their houses.,Albus Dumbledore,0
1804,"And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?",Albus Dumbledore,0
2178,"Dear lady, who did this to you?",Albus Dumbledore,0
2186,I didn't really expect him to linger.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4939,And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction?,Albus Dumbledore,0
3478,"Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort. The ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. And we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4956,As you wish.,Albus Dumbledore,1
7324,"Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2184,Very good.,Albus Dumbledore,1
2180,"Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7353,"I've never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7344,On.,Albus Dumbledore,1
7258,How long?,Albus Dumbledore,1
1,I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.,Albus Dumbledore,0

2601,Scabbers?,Albus Dumbledore,1
1268,"We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution to all.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5642,Trust me.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4147,"Ah, yes. I was wondering when we'd hit that little snag.",Albus Dumbledore,0

3383,On the count of three... ONE...,Albus Dumbledore,1
4960,Perhaps they're right.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4557,"Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study Occlumency.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4890,"Today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.  Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.  But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5550,... leaves traces.,Albus Dumbledore,1
7336,Yes.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4988,Yes.,Albus Dumbledore,1
5670,Severus...,Albus Dumbledore,1
5579,You will do so.,Albus Dumbledore,1
2174,Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.,Albus Dumbledore,0
5648,"Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I'm curious.  When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?",Albus Dumbledore,0
2948,That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty.,Albus Dumbledore,1
2652,It's such a very long name...,Albus Dumbledore,1
2046,"Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher... has decided to retire... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce... that his place will be taken by none other... than our own Rubeus Hagrid. Finally, on a more disquieting note... at the request of the Ministry of Magic... Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban... until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now whilst I've been assured... that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution. Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you... to give them no reason to harm you. It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But you know, happiness can be found... even in the darkest of times... if one only remembers to turn on the light.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4736,Both are waiting for you.,Albus Dumbledore,1

5582,Take my arm.,Albus Dumbledore,1
1822,I beg your pardon?,Albus Dumbledore,1
4605,There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none.,Albus Dumbledore,0
3791,... which are posted in an extensive list on the door to Mr. Filch's door.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4145,"Quiet, Harry!",Albus Dumbledore,1
4945,What you see before you are memories.  In this case pertaining to one individual:  Voldemort.  Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4935,"Enjoying your classes?  Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4712,Take matters into their own hands?,Albus Dumbledore,1
3379,and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...,Albus Dumbledore,0
3482,"No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5310,Why indeed.,Albus Dumbledore,1
3089,"Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4608,"It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2929,The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!,Albus Dumbledore,1
4979,It is unusual.  But not unheard of.,Albus Dumbledore,1
5661,"Say that again, Draco.  But aloud this time.",Albus Dumbledore,1
853,"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.  Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7276,"The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing...",Albus Dumbledore,0
5578,And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself...,Albus Dumbledore,0
861,"Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that's saying something.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7235,"If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5664,"Good evening, Bellatrix.  I think introductions are in order.",Albus Dumbledore,1
1806,"I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7340,That is up to you.,Albus Dumbledore,1
7264,"Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4951,Perhaps you could give me an example.,Albus Dumbledore,1
2670,How extraordinary.,Albus Dumbledore,1
3362,"Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5640,Hide yourself below.  And do not speak or show yourself without my permission.  No matter what.,Albus Dumbledore,0
1139,"I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4139,"Well, Minister. You've caught me.",Albus Dumbledore,1
5627,Water!,Albus Dumbledore,1
3292,You may begin at the start of the cannon.,Albus Dumbledore,0
1538,Riddle! Come.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4065,What news?,Albus Dumbledore,1
3481,Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4933,So.  How are you?,Albus Dumbledore,1
4125,"In point of fact, when young Potter met those students it was not illegal.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4542,"There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength...",Albus Dumbledore,0
3380,"The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7322,"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant to make.",Albus Dumbledore,0
870,"Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place: Gryffindor, with 312 points!  In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points!  Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points!  And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house!  Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account and I have a few last minute points to award.  First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points!  Second, to Mr Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years: fifty points!  And third, to mister Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house: sixty points!",Albus Dumbledore,0
4944,"... I was merely curious. In any event, I'm sure you're wondering why I've summoned you here tonight.  The answer lies here.",Albus Dumbledore,0
1547,Is there something you wish to tell me?,Albus Dumbledore,0
2878,"My dear old friend, thanks for coming.",Albus Dumbledore,1
5645,"I often talk aloud to myself.  I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven't been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco?",Albus Dumbledore,0
5587,"One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear.  But this much is known:  the children were damaged.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4552,It is my fault Sirius died tonight.,Albus Dumbledore,0
1808,"Not intentionally, but yes.",Albus Dumbledore,1
7272,"But this is touching, Severus. Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy?",Albus Dumbledore,0
7313,"Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5629,Go...,Albus Dumbledore,1
1136,They are not.,Albus Dumbledore,1
857,"Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.",Albus Dumbledore,0
1828,"Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this.",Albus Dumbledore,0
3378,Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory...,Albus Dumbledore,0
2452,"Yes, that's the... lings you see over there...",Albus Dumbledore,1
1364,There's been another attack.,Albus Dumbledore,0
2210,Arresto momentum!,Albus Dumbledore,1
5576,"Understand what I'm saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4984,"No.  I did not.  You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... I'd rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry.  But I promise. In time you will know everything.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7228,"Stand up, Severus. I haven't much time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?",Albus Dumbledore,0
4567,"Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4583,"This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2654,"Here we are, minister. Follow me. Now, look there.",Albus Dumbledore,1
4582,I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated.,Albus Dumbledore,0
3090,What are you doing here Miss Granger?,Albus Dumbledore,1
3790,"I beg a few moments of your attention, as I have a few start of term announcements. Right off, our caretaker, the good Mr. Filch, has reminded me for what he says is the four-hundred and sixty-second time that he had an annually updated list of various banned items, usually introduced by our humour experts Fred and George Weasley...",Albus Dumbledore,0
3477,Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4559,"Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4069,"Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys will need to be awoken.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2723,Well?,Albus Dumbledore,1
4541,"You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7248,"My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist.",Albus Dumbledore,0
12,The only family he has.,Albus Dumbledore,1
2928,"Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!",Albus Dumbledore,0
1545,"I understand Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.",Albus Dumbledore,0
855,Fine. They're both just fine.,Albus Dumbledore,1
7260,"Well, this makes matters much more straightforward.",Albus Dumbledore,1
5650,Then I shall make it easy for you.,Albus Dumbledore,1
7,"Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5537,This is beyond anything I imagined.  In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.  I know now... you will see worse.,Albus Dumbledore,0
1814,Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.,Albus Dumbledore,0
2869,"Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4891,"Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed.  Pip pip!",Albus Dumbledore,0
5659,"A passage, yes.  Very good. I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.  Let me help you, Draco.",Albus Dumbledore,0
1266,"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5617,"Too much... I can't... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!",Albus Dumbledore,0
5549,"True.  But magic, especially Dark magic...",Albus Dumbledore,0
1253,"Argus! Argus, I Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except you three.",Albus Dumbledore,0
15,"There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all.",Albus Dumbledore,1
7246,The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does.,Albus Dumbledore,0
2864,"And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4561,"I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7266,There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.,Albus Dumbledore,0
2930,The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour,Albus Dumbledore,0
2884,Silence!,Albus Dumbledore,1
5591,"Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much more precious than mine.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4141,"Quite correct, Cornelius.",Albus Dumbledore,1
4563,"Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5541,"They can be anything.  The most commonplace of objects.  A ring, for example.  Or a book...",Albus Dumbledore,0
5570,"At times I forget how much you've grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4958,No.  I am a Professor.,Albus Dumbledore,1
7350,'Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.',Albus Dumbledore,0
5624,Water. Water...,Albus Dumbledore,1
7231,How much did you relay?,Albus Dumbledore,1
3311,Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!,Albus Dumbledore,0
5405,"Ah, to be young and feel love's keen sting.  Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4571,Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now.,Albus Dumbledore,0
5601,Yes.,Albus Dumbledore,1
5552,Yes.  And I think... perhaps... I may have found another.  But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4886,"The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5589,"In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2867,Igor.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4159,Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk.,Albus Dumbledore,0
3327,"But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4888,"Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight.  You have a right to know why.",Albus Dumbledore,0
3369,Cast them away.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4064,"Naturally, naturally.",Albus Dumbledore,1
4123,"I'm not sure that's true, Professor.",Albus Dumbledore,1
2194,"Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep. For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own. Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5593,It's there.  The only question is how do we get to it?,Albus Dumbledore,0
3464,Harry get away from there!,Albus Dumbledore,0
4531,"Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my school.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5616,My fault.  It's all my fault...,Albus Dumbledore,0
2177,Keep moving!,Albus Dumbledore,1
5304,Confused?  I would be surprised if you weren't.,Albus Dumbledore,0
7334,"You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to save others from it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that I paid with my life.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4514,"There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2931,The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4588,Do you remember what you asked me that night?,Albus Dumbledore,1
5636,Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here...,Albus Dumbledore,0
5657,Ingenious.  Let me guess.  It has a sister.  A twin.,Albus Dumbledore,0
5306,"This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.  It's also a lie. This memory has been tampered with.  In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4519,"Stay where you are, Harry!",Albus Dumbledore,1
4524,"If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4537,Thank you...,Albus Dumbledore,1
5574,"The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry.  I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise.  But there is a condition:  You must obey any command I give you -- without question.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4725,Mind if I take this?  I do love knitting patterns.,Albus Dumbledore,0

3299,Harry!,Albus Dumbledore,1
5395,To whom might I ask?,Albus Dumbledore,1
5652,"Well done, Draco.  But I warn you. Killing is not nearly as easy.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5632,"I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5608,"Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry.",Albus Dumbledore,0
1812,"Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2872,"Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4527,"If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4971,"I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it.  Open.  It.",Albus Dumbledore,0
14,Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.,Albus Dumbledore,0

267,Let the feast...begin.,Albus Dumbledore,1
5572,"Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2677,"Well, search the skies, if you must, minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. Thank you.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2190,Many. Each as unlikely as the next.,Albus Dumbledore,1
1443,Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4887,"Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.  Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape.",Albus Dumbledore,0
3469,Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus.,Albus Dumbledore,0
7269,There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4693,"Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?  The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I'm afraid now is not the time to tell it.  Take my arm.",Albus Dumbledore,0

4068,Good.,Albus Dumbledore,1
2462,"Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on. All right. It'll be all right.",Albus Dumbledore,0
3332,"Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp.",Albus Dumbledore,0
3461,Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?,Albus Dumbledore,1
7239,"And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?",Albus Dumbledore,0
3349,The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am.,Albus Dumbledore,0
5,Hagrid is bringing him.,Albus Dumbledore,1

2040,"Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! Now, I'd like to say a few words... before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin... who's kindly consented to fill the post... of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Good luck, Professor.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4603,"Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2938,Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?,Albus Dumbledore,0
5613,Nooooooo!!!,Albus Dumbledore,1

4544,What can't I know?,Albus Dumbledore,1
5639,"No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5312,Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.  Any way you can.,Albus Dumbledore,0
7321,Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.,Albus Dumbledore,0

7244,He has her eyes.,Albus Dumbledore,1
1866,"Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled.",Albus Dumbledore,0
872,"And finally: it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten points to Neville Longbottom!  Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order!  Gryffindor wins the House Cup!",Albus Dumbledore,0

1830,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.",Albus Dumbledore,0

4715,That was fun.  May I use the loo?,Albus Dumbledore,1

4706,Dragon's blood.,Albus Dumbledore,1
5592,Careful.  The water.,Albus Dumbledore,1

2942,You're absolutely sure?,Albus Dumbledore,1
4709,"So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't perhaps expecting someone else, were you?",Albus Dumbledore,0

5630,We have to... go.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4510,"You should not have come here tonight, Tom.",Albus Dumbledore,0

5635,No.  Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened...,Albus Dumbledore,0
7227,That wasn't my intention.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4946,This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him.  I'd like you to see it.  If you would...,Albus Dumbledore,0

4610,Yes.,Albus Dumbledore,1
5596,Perhaps not.,Albus Dumbledore,1

3734,Excellent.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4727,"I think I know a lost cause when I see one.  Regrettable.  I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind.",Albus Dumbledore,0

5602,Remember... the water.,Albus Dumbledore,1
3463,Is he in this room? Is he in this room?,Albus Dumbledore,0
3290,"Welcome to the second task. Last night something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that they'll be on their own.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4071,"Phineas, I need you to visit your other portrait. Tell Sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4577,"She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated.",Albus Dumbledore,0

2885,"The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night.

4982,"Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.  Can you guess which teacher that might be?",Albus Dumbledore,0
4521,"Are you all right, Harry?",Albus Dumbledore,1
5604,Oh yes.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4963,It's a school.  A school of... magic.,Albus Dumbledore,1
2951,What do you suggest Minerva?,Albus Dumbledore,1
4708,"Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. Apparently there's some thought he may be the Chosen One.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5619,"Your word, Harry!  Your word!",Albus Dumbledore,1
2862,"So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5543,"It's a Horcrux, yes.  Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this I knew.  This was a different kind of magic.  Very dark.  Very powerful.  But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful...",Albus Dumbledore,0
5625,Aguamenti.,Albus Dumbledore,1
3092,Barty. The bag.,Albus Dumbledore,1
7315,"Oh, yes.",Albus Dumbledore,1
1543,"I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true.",Albus Dumbledore,1
7256,For the time being?,Albus Dumbledore,1
1826,Voldemort.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4704,"I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2448,"No, minister. Over this way.",Albus Dumbledore,1
4549,No.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4055,How did you see this? How were you positioned when you saw it?,Albus Dumbledore,0
3439,Tell me what happened!,Albus Dumbledore,1
596,"Back again, Harry?  I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.",Albus Dumbledore,0
1438,"Oh, and about time, too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes.",Albus Dumbledore,0
1257,"But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say",Albus Dumbledore,0
3473,Your arm Harry.,Albus Dumbledore,1
3312,"For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place! For outstanding moral fibre.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5597,"If you would, Harry...",Albus Dumbledore,1
4972,Take it out.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4516,"You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2656,Look beyond the rocks.,Albus Dumbledore,1

4545,"This pain is part of being human, Harry...",Albus Dumbledore,0
5547,One destroys Voldemort.,Albus Dumbledore,0
5569,"Harry.  You need a shave, my friend.",Albus Dumbledore,1
3727,"Only if the Dementors are still taking their orders from only the Ministry these days. I believe you know my views on this, Cornelius.",Albus Dumbledore,0
1449,"Very well, then. Off you go.",Albus Dumbledore,1
5580,"Your word, Harry.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4129,"Correct again. I must confess that I was, however, under the impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4701,Horace!,Albus Dumbledore,1
4569,Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries.,Albus Dumbledore,0
5621,Kill me!  It's the only way!,Albus Dumbledore,0
9,"No problems, I trust, Hagrid?",Albus Dumbledore,1
4574,Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact Headquarters.,Albus Dumbledore,0
7237,You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?,Albus Dumbledore,0
2668,All right.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4526,"Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses!",Albus Dumbledore,0
5643,"Good evening, Draco.  What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening?  Or is it Summer?",Albus Dumbledore,0
4152,"Naturally. All of you did rather well on your spellwork at this school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I'm afraid I shall have to hurt you.",Albus Dumbledore,0
3475,"Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2663,Over there.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4729,Indeed they are.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4155,I'm not going into hiding. Fudge will soon regret removing me from Hogwarts.,Albus Dumbledore,0
1818,"When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.",Albus Dumbledore,0
1549,"Very well, then. Off you go.",Albus Dumbledore,1
1367,It means that our students are in great danger.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4590,"You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4974,"Why did you want these things, Tom?",Albus Dumbledore,1
4108,"Happily, that will not be necessary. I have found a successor",Albus Dumbledore,0
7233,The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July --,Albus Dumbledore,0
1255,"She's not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5584,Being me has its privileges.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4532,All Educational Decrees will be nullified and you will call off the search on Hagrid so he can return to work.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4581,I was trying to save his life!,Albus Dumbledore,1
4714,"Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don't you? Mind?",Albus Dumbledore,0
3459,Do you know who I am?,Albus Dumbledore,1
5641,"Do as I say, Harry.",Albus Dumbledore,1
3296,The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task.,Albus Dumbledore,0
1820,"Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.",Albus Dumbledore,0
3102,Three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant.,Albus Dumbledore,0
2953,You heard Barty the rules are clear.,Albus Dumbledore,1
7318,Not.,Albus Dumbledore,1
16,Good luck...Harry Potter.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4973,Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?,Albus Dumbledore,0
7261,"Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort's plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?",Albus Dumbledore,0
1824,"Oh, yes.",Albus Dumbledore,1
4889,"Once there was a young man who, like you, sat in this very Hall. Walked this castle's corridors. Slept beneath its roof.  He seemed, to all the world, a student like any other.  His name? Tom Riddle. The Hall goes utterly silent.",Albus Dumbledore,0
851,"Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?",Albus Dumbledore,1
3381,"In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way.",Albus Dumbledore,0
1447,"No, Harry. I do not think it was you But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?",Albus Dumbledore,0
7358,"Actually, if I think about it... it doesn't seem curious at all.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5605,It has to be drunk.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4157,"It's fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape tells you.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4697,"Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I assume right about now you're wondering why I've brought you here, am I right?",Albus Dumbledore,0
5653,You're not alone.  Are you.  There are others.  How?,Albus Dumbledore,1
5646,"You are not an assassin, Draco.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5308,I suspect he is ashamed of it.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4539,"I understand how you feel, Harry--",Albus Dumbledore,0
4135,"Again, I cannot have you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4149,But I do. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I would 'come quietly.',Albus Dumbledore,0
4734,"You'll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7250,"Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4564,"During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7342,"Oh yes. We are in King's Cross, you say? I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let's say, board a train.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7252,Perhaps. oOh. Severus.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4932,"Good evening, Harry.  You got my message, I see.  Come, come.  Sit.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5539,"Oh he succeeded.  And not just once.  Think, Harry.  He's just told us.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4595,That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4109,...the Ministry can only appoint new teachers if I cannot find one. I think you will find him suitable enough.,Albus Dumbledore,0
3458,Severus...,Albus Dumbledore,1
1541,"It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4158,"Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Fudge is stirring.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4062,"Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4943,"Forgive me, Harry, I...",Albus Dumbledore,0
4579,He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated.,Albus Dumbledore,0
2725,Did what? Good night.,Albus Dumbledore,1
1799,And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.,Albus Dumbledore,0
5614,Make it stop... Please... make it stop...,Albus Dumbledore,0
3,"I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.",Albus Dumbledore,1
5672,Severus... please.,Albus Dumbledore,1
7331,"You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn't trust",Albus Dumbledore,0
1610,"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2188,"Quite remarkable, yes.",Albus Dumbledore,1
4127,"Again, quite correct. However, I wonder if you have any evidence that proves this group has been meeting since then?",Albus Dumbledore,0
1436,Harry?,Albus Dumbledore,1
4585,"Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5577,"Should I tell you to run, you will run.",Albus Dumbledore,1
2604,"I do, Miss Granger. But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true... is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. Mysterious thing, time. Powerful... and when meddled with, dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight... more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns should do it, I think. Oh, and by the way. When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5311,I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you've done so.,Albus Dumbledore,0
7312,You cannot help.,Albus Dumbledore,1
1796,"You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?",Albus Dumbledore,0
5393,"This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4586,"And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4547,You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it.,Albus Dumbledore,0
598,"Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4953,"How do you do, Tom.",Albus Dumbledore,1
2459,I'd like to have a cup of tea.,Albus Dumbledore,1
5611,Don't... don't make me...,Albus Dumbledore,1
4607,"There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It states ""neither can live while the other survives.""",Albus Dumbledore,0
3465,Are you alright Alastor?,Albus Dumbledore,0
4976,"Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? I'll be going now, Tom.  Leave your window open tonight.  An owl will bring you a message.  Read it carefully.",Albus Dumbledore,0
7348,Yes.,Albus Dumbledore,1
3101,Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon...,Albus Dumbledore,0
4937,Do you?,Albus Dumbledore,1
7327,I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?,Albus Dumbledore,0
4962,Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4551,"I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand, Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it.",Albus Dumbledore,0
1802,"Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5573,A trait people never fail to undervalue.  I'm afraid.,Albus Dumbledore,1
1617,"Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?",Albus Dumbledore,0
3479,"I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4061,Raise the alarm. We must make sure Arthur is found by the right people.,Albus Dumbledore,0
7355,Luck.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4057,Is Arthur seriously injured?,Albus Dumbledore,0
3471,Barty Crouch Junior.,Albus Dumbledore,1
1810,"It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?",Albus Dumbledore,0
1605,"Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we?",Albus Dumbledore,1
5392,Why indeed.,Albus Dumbledore,1
4538,"Please sit, Harry.",Albus Dumbledore,1
4566,"Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams.",Albus Dumbledore,0
865,"Love, Harry, love.  Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee... Mm. Alas. Earwax.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4948,I am not family.  But his name has been known to me since birth.,Albus Dumbledore,0
3441,"It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are.",Albus Dumbledore,1
4691,I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk.  No light could resist it...,Albus Dumbledore,0
7268,"On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4063,"Fawkes, we will need a warning.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5606,"You remember the condition on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me.  It might cause me to forget why I'm here.  It might create so much pain I beg for relief.  You are not to indulge these requests, Harry.  It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.  Understood?",Albus Dumbledore,0
4731,"You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values.  Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry.  You would be his crowning jewel.  That is why he is returning to Hogwarts.  And it is crucial he return...",Albus Dumbledore,0
5655,That cabinet has been broken for years.,Albus Dumbledore,1
5389,"Quick thinking on your part, Harry.  Using a Bezoar.  You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?",Albus Dumbledore,0
4575,Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called.,Albus Dumbledore,0
4941,I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.  One can't help but wonder if --,Albus Dumbledore,0
3364,"He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask?",Albus Dumbledore,0
2959,"Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are.",Albus Dumbledore,0
3368,"I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply...",Albus Dumbledore,0
5568,"Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.  I will not negotiate this with you, Severus.  You agreed.  There's nothing more to discuss.",Albus Dumbledore,0
2665,Over there.,Albus Dumbledore,1
5586,"This is the place.  Oh yes, this place has known magic. Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty...",Albus Dumbledore,0
2454,"On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.",Albus Dumbledore,1
7332,"I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave your pardon, Harry. It's clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4981,Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time?  No.  Had I...,Albus Dumbledore,0
4153,Are you all right?,Albus Dumbledore,1
2933,Harry Potter. Harry Potter?,Albus Dumbledore,1
7361,"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real?",Albus Dumbledore,0
863,"Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?  It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.",Albus Dumbledore,0
4059,You were listening?,Albus Dumbledore,1
2170,Make way.,Albus Dumbledore,1
2861,"Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...",Albus Dumbledore,0
4599,"Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom.",Albus Dumbledore,0
5508,How is he?  Horace?,Albus Dumbledore,1
7254,I was... foolish... greedy...,Albus Dumbledore,1
2675,I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. How could you? You've been with us all the time.,Albus Dumbledore,0
